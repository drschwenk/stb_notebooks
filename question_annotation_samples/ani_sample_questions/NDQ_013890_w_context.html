        <h3>Heating Systems</h3>
        <p>Warming homes and other buildings is an obvious way that thermal energy can be used. Two common types of home heating systems are hot-water and warm-air heating systems. Both types are described below. You can watch an animation showing how a solar heating system works at this URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>HotWater Heating System</h3>
        <p>A hot-water heating system uses thermal energy to heat water and then pumps the hot water throughout the building in a system of pipes and radiators. You can see a diagram of this type of heating system in Figure 18.12. Typically, the water is heated in a boiler that burns natural gas or heating oil. There is usually a radiator in each room that gets warm when the hot water flows through it. The radiator transfers thermal energy to the air around it by conduction and radiation. The warm air then circulates throughout the room in convection currents. The hot water cools as it flows through the system and transfers its thermal energy. When it finally returns to the boiler, it is heated again and the cycle repeats. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>WarmAir Heating System</h3>
        <p>A warm-air heating system uses thermal energy to heat air. It then forces the warm air through a system of ducts. You can see a diagram of this type of heating system in Figure 18.13. Typically, the air is heated in a furnace that burns natural gas or heating oil. When the air is warm, a fan blows it through the ducts and out through vents that are located in each room. Warm air blowing out of a vent moves across the room, pushing cold air out of the way. The cold air enters an intake vent on the opposite side of the room and returns to the furnace with the help of another fan. In the furnace, the cold air is heated, and the cycle repeats. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 18.13 The warm-air vent is placed near the floor of the room. Warm air is less dense than cold air so it rises. If the warm-air vent were placed near the ceiling instead, how would this affect the transfer of thermal energy throughout the room?</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cooling Systems</h3>
        <p>Its easy to see how thermal energy can be used to keep things warm. But did you know that thermal energy can also be used to keep things cool? Cooling systems such as air conditioners and refrigerators transfer thermal energy in order to keep homes and cars cool or to keep food cold. In a refrigerator, for example, thermal energy is transferred from the cool air inside the refrigerator to the warmer air in the kitchen. You read in this chapters "Transfer of Thermal Energy" lesson that thermal energy always moves from a warmer area to a cooler area, so how can it move from the cooler refrigerator to the warmer room? The answer is work. The refrigerator does work to transfer thermal energy in this way. Doing this work takes energy, which is usually provided by electricity. Figure 18.14 explains how a refrigerator does its work. For an animated demonstration of how a refrigerator works, go to this URL:  The key to how a refrigerator or other cooling system works is the refrigerant. A refrigerant is a substance, such as FreonTM, that has a low boiling point and changes between liquid and gaseous states as it passes through the cooling system. As a liquid, the refrigerant absorbs thermal energy from the cool air inside the refrigerator and changes to a gas. As a gas, it releases thermal energy to the warm air outside the refrigerator and changes back to a liquid. </p>

        <h3>Combustion Engines</h3>
        <p>A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the energy to do work. Two basic types of combustion engines are external and internal combustion engines. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>External Combustion Engine</h3>
        <p>An external combustion engine burns fuel externally, or outside the engine. The burning fuel releases thermal energy that is used to turn water to steam. The pressure of the steam is then used to move a piston back and forth in a cylinder. The kinetic energy of the moving piston can be used to turn a turbine or other device. Figure 18.15 explains in greater detail how this type of engine works. You can see an animated version of an external combustion engine at this URL: http://science.howstuffworks.com/transport/engines-equipment/steam1.htm . </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Internal Combustion Engine</h3>
        <p>An internal combustion engine (see Figure 18.16) burns fuel internally, or inside the engine. This type of engine is found in most cars and other motor vehicles. It works in these steps, which keep repeating: 1. A mixture of fuel and air is pulled into a cylinder through a valve, which then closes. 2. The piston is pushed upward, compressing the fuel-air mixture in the closed cylinder. The mixture is now under a lot of pressure and very warm. 3. A spark from a spark plug is used to ignite the fuel-air mixture, causing it to burn explosively within the confined space of the closed cylinder. 4. The pressure of the hot gases from combustion forces the piston downward. 5. When the piston moves up again, it forces the exhaust gases of combustion out of the cylinder though another valve. Then the process repeats. In a car, the piston is connected by the piston rod to the crankshaft. The crankshaft rotates when the piston moves up and down. The kinetic energy of the moving crankshaft is used to turn the driveshaft, which causes the wheels of the car to turn. Most cars have at least four cylinders connected to the crankshaft. Their pistons move up and down in sequence, one after the other.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Two common home heating systems are hot-water and warm-air heating systems. They burn fuel for thermal energy and transfer the energy to water or air. The heated water or air circulates throughout the house, transferring thermal energy to the air in each room. Cooling systems such as air conditioners and refrigerators reverse the normal direction of heat flow by doing work. For example, a refrigerator uses a refrigerant to transfer thermal energy from a cool refrigerator to a warm room. A combustion engine is a complex machine that burns fuel to produce thermal energy and then uses the thermal energy to do work. Combustion engines may by external or internal combustion engines, depending on where the fuel is burned. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this chapter, you read that thermal energy can travel in waves by radiation. You can learn more about waves in the next chapter. What other forms of energy travel in waves? (Hint: How does sound energy travel?) Think about waves in the ocean. How do the waves move? How do you think they carry energy? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Ashley feels chilly, so she turns up the thermostat (pictured in Figure 18.11). She hears the furnace switch on in the basement, and in just a few minutes, warm air is blowing out of vents in the floor. Before long, the whole house is much warmer. Modern home heating systems keep us comfortable in cold weather. We may even depend on them for our survival. But we often take them for granted. Do you know how a home heating system works? Do you know how it turns fuel to thermal energy or how it circulates thermal energy throughout the house? In this lesson, youll find out. </p>
