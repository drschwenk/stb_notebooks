        <h3>Nonvascular Seedless Plants</h3>
        <p>Nonvascular seedless plants, as their name implies, lack vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. As they lack vascular tissue, they also do not have true roots, stems, or leaves. Nonvascular plants do often have a leafy appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and root-like structures. These plants are very short because they cannot move nutrients and water up a stem. Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as bryophytes, are classified into three phyla: 1. Mosses 2. Hornworts 3. Liverworts </p>

        <h3>Mosses</h3>
        <p>Mosses are most often recognized as the green fuzz on damp rocks and trees in a forest. If you look closely, you will see that most mosses have tiny stem-like and leaf-like structures. This is the gametophyte stage. Remember that a gametophyte is haploid, having only one set of chromosomes. The gametophyte produces the gametes that, after fertilization, develop into the diploid sporophyte with two sets of chromosomes. The sporophyte forms a capsule, called the sporangium, which releases spores ( Figure 1.1). Sporophytes sprout up on stalks from this bed of moss gametophytes. Notice that both the sporophytes and gametophytes exist at the same time. </p>

        <h3>Hornworts</h3>
        <p>Hornworts are named for their appearance. The "horn" part of the name comes from their hornlike sporophytes, and wort comes from the Anglo-Saxon word for herb. The hornlike sporophytes grow from a base of flattened lobes, which are the gametophytes ( Figure 1.2). They usually grow in moist and humid areas. In hornworts, the horns are the sporo- phytes that rise up from the leaflike ga- metophyte. </p>

        <h3>Liverworts</h3>
        <p>Liverworts have two distinct appearances: they can either be leafy like mosses or flattened and ribbon-like. Liver- worts get their name from the type with the flattened bodies, which can resemble a liver ( Figure 1.3). Liverworts can often be found along stream beds. Liverworts with a flattened, ribbon-like body are called thallose liverworts. </p>
