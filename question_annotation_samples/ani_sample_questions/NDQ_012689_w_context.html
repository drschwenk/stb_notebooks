        <h3>Solutes and Solvents</h3>
        <p>A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent. For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table 10.1 and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter. Solution Gas dissolved in gas Example: Earths atmosphere Gas dissolved in liquid Example: carbonated water Liquid dissolved in gas Example: moist air Solute oxygen (and other gases) Solvent nitrogen carbon dioxide water water air Solution Liquid dissolved in liquid Example: vinegar Solid dissolved in liquid Example: sweet tea Solid dissolved in solid Example: bronze Solute acetic acid Solvent water sugar tea copper tin When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes to the same state as the solvent. For example, when solid salt dissolves in liquid water, it becomes part of the liquid solution, salt water. If the solute and solvent are already in the same state, the substance present in greater quantity is considered to be the solvent. For example, nitrogen is the solvent in Earths atmosphere because it makes up 78 percent of air. </p>

        <h3>How a Solute Dissolves</h3>
        <p>When a solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles that spread evenly throughout the solvent. Exactly how this happens depends on the type of bonds the solute contains. Solutes with ionic bonds, such as table salt (NaCl), separate into individual ions (Na+ and Cl ). Solutes with covalent bonds, such as glucose (H6 C12 O6 ), separate into individual molecules. In either case, the individual ions or molecules spread apart and are surrounded by molecules of the solvent. This is illustrated in Figure 10.1 and in the videos at the URLs below.

        <h3>Rate of Dissolving</h3>
        <p>When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you dont stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. Thats because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>The AlmostUniversal Solvent</h3>
        <p>Water is a polar compound. This means it has positively and negatively charged ends. This is why it is so good at dissolving ionic compounds such as salt and polar covalent compounds such as sugar. Solutes that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, are said to be soluble in that solvent. So many solutes are soluble in water that water is called the universal solvent. However, there are substances that dont dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesnt work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so it doesnt dissolve in water. In other words, it is insoluble in water. Instead, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used to dissolve nonpolar paint.

        <h3>Properties of Solutions</h3>
        <p>When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. Two properties that change when a solute is added are the freezing and boiling points. Generally, solutes lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of solvents. You can see some examples of this in Figure below. To see why solutes change the freezing and boiling points of solvents, watch this video:  (14:00). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. Create a lesson that explains to younger students how solutions form. With your teachers approval, request permission to present your lesson to students in a lower grade. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how solutions form.
Identify properties of solutions.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A solution forms when a solute dissolves in a solvent. The rate of dissolving is faster with stirring, a higher temperature, or greater surface area. Many solutes are soluble in water because water is polar. Solutes change the physical properties of solvents. They lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of solvents. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Assume that you will stir salt into a cup of hot water to make a saltwater solution. How much salt do you think you could dissolve in the cup of hot water? Do you think you could dissolve more of some solutes than others? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>When rocks or other substances dissolve in water, they form a solution. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The particles of a solution are mixed evenly throughout it. The particles are too small to be seen or to settle out. An example of a solution is salt water. </p>
