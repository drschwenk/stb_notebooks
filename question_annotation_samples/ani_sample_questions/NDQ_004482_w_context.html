        <h3>Extrasolar Planets or Exoplanets</h3>
        <p>Since the early 1990s, astronomers have discovered other solar systems, with planets orbiting stars other than our own Sun. These are called "extrasolar planets" or simply exoplanets (see Figure 1.1). Exoplanets are not in our solar system, but are found in other solar systems. Some extrasolar planets have been directly imaged, but most have been discovered by indirect methods. One technique involves detecting the very slight motion of a star periodically moving toward and away from us along our line-of-sight (also known as a stars "radial velocity"). This periodic motion can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a planet or, sometimes, another star orbiting the star. A planet may also be identified by measuring a stars brightness over time. A temporary, periodic decrease in light emitted from a star can occur when a planet crosses in front of, or "transits," the star it is orbiting, momentarily blocking out some of the starlight. More than 1800 extrasolar planets have been identified and confirmed and the rate of discovery is increasing rapidly. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Now that scientists know how to identify extrasolar planets, the numbers of confirmed examples are increasing rapidly. An exoplanet may decrease a stars brightness as it passes in front of it. The gravitational pull of a planet may be detected in the slight motion of a star. </p>
