        <h3>Causes and Types of Stress</h3>
        <p>Stress is the force applied to a rock. There are four types of stresses: Confining stress happens as weight of all the overlying rock pushes down on a deeply buried rock. The rock is being pushed in from all sides, which compresses it. The rock will not deform because there is no place for it to move. Compression stress squeezes rocks together. Compression causes rocks to fold or fracture (Figure 7.1). When two cars collide, compression causes them to crumple. Compression is the most common stress at convergent plate boundaries. Tension stress pulls rocks apart. Tension causes rocks to lengthen or break apart. Tension is the major type of stress found at divergent plate boundaries. Shear stress happens when forces slide past each other in opposite directions (Figure 7.2). This is the most common stress found at transform plate boundaries. The amount of stress on a rock may be greater than the rocks strength. In that case, the rock will change and deform (Figure 7.3). Deep within the Earth, the pressure is very great. A rock behaves like a stretched rubber band. When the stress stops, the rock goes back to its original shape. If more stress is applied to the rock, it bends and flows. It does not return to its original shape. Near the surface, if the stress continues, the rock will fracture and break. </p>

        <h3>Geologic Structures</h3>
        <p>Sedimentary rocks are formed in horizontal layers. This is magnificently displayed around the southwestern United States. The arid climate allows rock layers to be well exposed (Figure 7.4). The lowest layers are the oldest and the higher layers are younger. Folds, joints and faults are caused by stresses. Figure 7.5 shows joints in a granite hillside. If a sedimentary rock is tilted or folded, we know that stresses have changed the rock (Figure 7.6). </p>

        <h3>Folds</h3>
        <p>Deep within the Earth, as plates collide, rocks crumple into folds. You can model these folds by placing your hands on opposite edges of a piece of cloth and pushing your hands together. In sedimentary rocks, you can easily trace the folding of the layers. In the Figure 7.6, the rock layers are no longer horizontal. They tilt downhill from right to left in a monocline. Once rocks are folded, they do not return to their original shape. There are three types of folds: monoclines, anticlines, and synclines. A monocline is a simple one step bend in the rock layers (Figure 7.7). In a monocline, the oldest rocks are still at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. An anticline is a fold that arches upward. The rocks dip away from the center of the fold (Figure 7.8). The oldest rocks are found at the center of an anticline. The youngest rocks are draped over them at the top of the structure. When upward folding rocks form a circular structure, that structure is called a dome. If the top of the dome is eroded off, the oldest rocks are exposed at the center. A syncline is a fold that bends downward (Figure 7.9). In a syncline, the youngest rocks are at the center. The oldest rocks are at the outside edges. When rocks bend downward in a circular structure, it is called a basin. If the rocks are eroded, the youngest rocks are at the center. Basins can be enormous, like the Michigan Basin. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Faults</h3>
        <p>With enough stress, a rock will fracture, or break. The fracture is called a joint if the rock breaks but doesnt move, as shown in Figure 7.10. If the rocks on one or both sides of a fracture move, the fracture is called a fault (Figure 7.11). Faults can occur alone or in clusters, creating a fault zone. Earthquakes happen when rocks break and move suddenly. The energy released causes an earthquake. Slip is the distance rocks move along a fault, as one block of rock moves past the other. The angle of a fault is called When compression squeezes the crust into a smaller space, the hanging wall pushes up relative to the footwall. This creates a reverse fault. A thrust fault is a type of reverse fault where the angle is nearly horizontal. Rocks can slip many miles along thrust faults (Figure 7.13). </p>

(B) A large fault runs between the lighter colored rock on the left and the darker colored rock on the right. There has been so much movement along the fault that the darker rock doesnt resemble anything around it. the faults dip. If the fault dips at an angle, the fault is a dip-slip fault. Imagine you are standing on a road looking at the fault. The hanging wall is the rock that overlies the fault, while the footwall is beneath the fault. If you are walking along a fault, the hanging wall is above you and the footwall is where your feet would be. Miners often extract mineral resources along faults. They used to hang their lanterns above their heads. That is why these layers were called the hanging wall. In normal faults, the hanging wall drops down relative to the footwall. Normal faults are caused by tension that pulls the crust apart, causing the hanging wall to slide down. Normal faults can build huge mountain ranges in regions experiencing tension (Figure 7.12).</p>

        <h3>StrikeSlip</h3>
        <p>A strike-slip fault is a dip-slip fault where the dip of the fault plane is vertical. Strike-slip faults result from shear stresses. If you stand with one foot on each side of a strike-slip fault, one side will be moving toward you while the other side moves away from you. If your right foot moves toward you, the fault is known as a right-lateral strike-slip fault. If your left foot moves toward you, the fault is a left-lateral strike-slip fault (Figure 7.14). </p>

        </p>
        <h3>San Andreas Fault</h3>
        <p>The San Andreas Fault in California is a right-lateral strike-slip fault (Figure 7.15). It is also a transform fault because the San Andreas is a plate boundary. As you can see, California will not fall into the ocean someday. The land west of the San Andreas Fault is moving northeastward, while the North American plate moves southwest. Someday, millions of years from now, Los Angeles will be a suburb of San Francisco! </p>

        <h3>Stress and Mountain Building</h3>
        <p>Many processes create mountains. Most mountains form along plate boundaries. A few mountains may form in the middle of a plate. For example, huge volcanoes are mountains formed at hotspots within the Pacific Plate. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>ContinentContinent Convergence</h3>
        <p>Most of the worlds largest mountains form as plates collide at convergent plate boundaries. Continents are too buoyant to get pushed down into the mantle. So when the plates smash together, the crust crumples upwards. This creates mountains. Folding and faulting in these collision zones makes the crust thicker. The worlds highest mountain range, the Himalayas, is growing as India collides with Eurasia. About 80 million years ago, India was separated from Eurasia by an ocean (Figure 7.16). As the plates collided, pieces of the old seafloor were forced over the Asian continent. This old seafloor is now found high in the Himalayas (Figure 7.17). </p>

        <h3>Oceanic Plate Subduction</h3>
        <p>Volcanic mountain ranges form when oceanic crust is pushed down into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The Andes Mountains are a chain of coastal volcanic mountains. They are forming as the Nazca plate subducts beneath the South American plate (Figure 7.18). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Rifting</h3>
        <p>Mid-ocean ridges form at divergent plate boundaries. As the ocean floor separates an enormous line of volcanoes is created. When continental crust is pulled apart, it breaks into blocks. These blocks of crust are separated by normal faults. The blocks slide up or down. The result is alternating mountain ranges and valleys. This topography is known as basin-and-range (Figure 7.19). The area near Death Valley, California is the center of a classic basin-and-range province (Figure 7.20). </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. What happens when a rock deforms plastically? For how long does this happen? What factors should be considered when answering that last question? 6. Why is California know for having so many large earthquakes? 7. Imagine that you find a sequence of rock layers with the older rocks at the top and the younger rocks at the bottom. How could this have happened? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>List the different types of stresses that change rock.
Compare the different types of folds and the conditions under which they form.
Compare fractures and faults and define how they are related to earthquakes.
Compare how mountains form and at what types of plate boundaries.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Stress is the force applied to a rock, which can cause the rock to change. The three main types of stress go along with the three types of plate boundaries. Compression is common at convergent boundaries, tension at divergent boundaries, and shear at transform boundaries. Rocks can bend and fold. Rocks can also fracture and break. Movement along a fracture produces a fault. The two main types of faults are dip-slip and strike-slip. In dip-slip faults, the angle of the fault plane is at an angle. In strike-slip faults, the fault plane is vertical. The worlds largest mountains grow at convergent plate boundaries, primarily by thrust faulting and folding. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Think about stresses in the ocean basins. Where in the ocean basins are plates pulling apart? Where do plates come together? Earthquakes are primarily the result of plate tectonic motions. What type of stress would cause earthquakes at each of the three types of plate boundaries? Which type of plate boundary do you think has the most dangerous earthquakes? How do earthquakes cause the greatest damage? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>When plates collide, move apart, and slide past each other, lots of things happen. Nearly all earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building happens at plate boundaries. When plates are pushed or pulled, the rock is subjected to stress. Stress can cause a rock to change shape or to break. When a rock bends without breaking, it folds. When the rock breaks, it fractures. Mountain building and earthquakes are some of the responses rocks have to stress. </p>

        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What causes confining stress? What type of deformation is caused by confining stress? 2. What causes compression stress? What type of deformation is caused by compression stress? 3. What causes tension stress? What type of deformation is caused by tension stress? 4. What causes shear stress? What type of deformation is caused by shear stress? </p>
