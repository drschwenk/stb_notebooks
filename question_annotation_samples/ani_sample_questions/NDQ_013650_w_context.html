        <h3>Defining Energy</h3>
        <p>The concept of energy was first introduced in the chapter "States of Matter," where it is defined as the ability to cause change in matter. Energy can also be defined as the ability to do work. Work is done whenever a force is used to move matter. When work is done, energy is transferred from one object to another. For example, when the batter in Figure 17.2 uses energy to swing the bat, she transfers energy to the bat. The moving bat, in turn, transfers energy to the ball. Like work, energy is measured in the joule (J), or newtonmeter (Nm). Energy exists in different forms, which you can read about in the lesson "Forms of Energy" later in the chapter. Some forms of energy are mechanical, electrical, and chemical energy. Most forms of energy can also be classified as kinetic or potential energy. Kinetic and potential forms of mechanical energy are the focus of this lesson. Mechanical energy is the energy of objects that are moving or have the potential to move. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Kinetic Energy</h3>
        <p>What do all the photos in Figure 17.3 have in common? All of them show things that are moving. Kinetic energy is the energy of moving matter. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy from the atoms in matter to the planets in solar systems. Things with kinetic energy can do work. For example, the hammer in the photo is doing the work of pounding the nail into the board. You can see a cartoon introduction to kinetic energy and its relation to work at this URL:  . The amount of kinetic energy in a moving object depends on its mass and velocity. An object with greater mass or greater velocity has more kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a moving object can be calculated with the equation: 1 Kinetic Energy (KE) = mass  velocity2 2 This equation for kinetic energy shows that velocity affects kinetic energy more than mass does. For example, if mass doubles, kinetic energy also doubles. But if velocity doubles, kinetic energy increases by a factor of four. Thats because velocity is squared in the equation. You can see for yourself how mass and velocity affect kinetic energy by working through the problems below. Problem Solving Problem: Juan has a mass of 50 kg. If he is running at a velocity of 2 m/s, how much kinetic energy does he have? Solution: Use the formula: KE = 12 mass  velocity2 1 50 kg  (2 m/s2 ) 2 = 100 kg  m2 /s2 = 100 N  m, or 100 J KE = You Try It! Problem: What is Juans kinetic energy if he runs at a velocity of 4 m/s? Problem: Juans dad has a mass of 100 kg. How much kinetic energy does he have if he runs at a velocity of 2 m/s? </p>

        <h3>Potential Energy</h3>
        <p>Did you ever see a scene like the one in Figure 17.4? In many parts of the world, trees lose their leaves in autumn. The leaves turn color and then fall from the trees to the ground. As the leaves are falling, they have kinetic energy. While they are still attached to the trees they also have energy, but its not because of motion. Instead, they have stored energy, called potential energy. An object has potential energy because of its position or shape. For example leaves on trees have potential energy because they could fall due to the pull of gravity. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>FIGURE 17.4 Before leaves fall from trees in autumn, they have potential energy. Why do they have the potential to fall?</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3>
        <p>Potential energy due to the position of an object above Earth is called gravitational potential energy. Like the leaves on trees, anything that is raised up above Earths surface has the potential to fall because of gravity. You can see examples of people with gravitational potential energy in Figure 17.5. Gravitational potential energy depends on an objects weight and its height above the ground. It can be calculated with the equation: Gravitational potential energy (GPE) = weight  height Consider the diver in Figure 17.5. If he weighs 70 newtons and the diving board is 5 meters above Earths surface, then his potential energy is: GPE = 70 N  5 m = 350 N  m, or 350 J </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Elastic Potential Energy</h3>
        <p>Potential energy due to an objects shape is called elastic potential energy. This energy results when elastic objects are stretched or compressed. Their elasticity gives them the potential to return to their original shape. For example, the rubber band in Figure 17.6 has been stretched, but it will spring back to its original shape when released. Springs like the handspring in the figure have elastic potential energy when they are compressed. What will happen when the handspring is released? </p>

        <h3>Energy Conversion</h3>
        <p>Remember the diver in Figure 17.5? What happens when he jumps off the diving board? His gravitational potential energy changes to kinetic energy as he falls toward the water. However, he can regain his potential energy by getting out of the water and climbing back up to the diving board. This requires an input of kinetic energy. These changes in energy are examples of energy conversion, the process in which energy changes from one type or form to another. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Conservation of Energy</h3>
        <p>The law of conservation of energy applies to energy conversions. Energy is not used up when it changes form, although some energy may be used to overcome friction, and this energy is usually given off as heat. For example, the divers kinetic energy at the bottom of his fall is the same as his potential energy when he was on the diving board, except for a small amount of heat resulting from friction with the air as he falls. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Examples of Energy Conversions</h3>
        <p>There are many other examples of energy conversions between potential and kinetic energy. Figure 17.7 describes how potential energy changes to kinetic energy and back again on swings and trampolines. You can see an animation of changes between potential and kinetic energy on a ramp at the URL below. Can you think of other examples? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Energy is the ability to do work. When work is done, energy is transferred from one object to another. Energy can exist in different forms, such as electrical and chemical energy. Most forms of energy can also be classified as kinetic or potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of moving matter. Things with kinetic energy can do work. Kinetic energy depends on an objects mass and velocity. Potential energy is the energy stored in an object because of its position or shape. It includes gravitational potential energy and elastic potential energy. Gravitational potential energy depends on an objects weight and height above the ground. Energy conversion occurs when energy changes from one type or form of energy to another. Energy often changes between potential and kinetic energy. Energy is always conserved during energy conversions. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The examples of kinetic and potential energy you read about in this lesson are types of mechanical energy. Mechan- ical energy is one of several forms of energy you can read about in the next lesson, "Forms of Energy." Based on the examples in this lesson, how would you define mechanical energy? What might be other examples of mechanical energy? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Did you ever babysit younger children, like the children in Figure 17.1? If you did, then you probably noticed that young children are often very active. They seem to be in constant motion. It may be hard to keep up with their boundless energy. What is energy, and where does it come from? Read on to find out. </p>
