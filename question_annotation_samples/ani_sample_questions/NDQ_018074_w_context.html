        <h3>Combining Forces</h3>
        <p>When the archer releases the bowstring, the arrow will be flung forward toward the top of the target where shes aiming. But another force will also act on the arrow in a different direction. The other force is gravity, and it will pull the arrow down toward Earth. The two forces combined will cause the arrow to move in the curved path shown in the Figure 1.1. This type of motion is called projectile motion. It occurs whenever an object curves down toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it. Because of projectile motion, to hit the bulls eye of a target with an arrow, you actually have to aim for a spot above the bulls eye. You can see in theFigure 1.2 what happens if you aim at the bulls eye instead of above it. </p>

        <h3>Another Example of Projectile Motion</h3>
        <p>You can probably think of other examples of projectile motion. One is shown in the Figure 1.3. The cannon shoots a ball straight ahead, giving it horizontal motion. At the same time, gravity pulls the ball down toward the ground. Q: How would you show the force of gravity on the cannon ball in the Figure 1.3? A: You would add a line pointing straight down from the cannon to the ground. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Projectile motion is movement of an object in a curved path toward the ground because it has both a horizontal force and the downward force of gravity acting on it. Examples of objects that have projectile motion include arrows and cannon balls. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. What is projectile motion? When does it occur? 2. How might knowledge of projectile motion help you shoot baskets in basketball? </p>
