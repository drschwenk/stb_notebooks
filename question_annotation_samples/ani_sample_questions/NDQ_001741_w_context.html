        <h3>Using Energy</h3>
        <p>Think about your typical day. How do you use energy? Do you take a shower when you first get out of bed? What about taking a shower uses energy? It takes energy to heat the water and to pump the water to your home. Do you eat a hot breakfast? Energy is used to cook your food. Do you ride a bus or have someone drive you to school? Motor vehicles need energy from fossil fuels to run. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Energy Use in the U.S.</h3>
        <p>Figure 20.10 shows the major ways energy is used in the U.S. A lot of energy is used in homes. In fact, more energy is used in homes than in stores and businesses. Even more energy is used for transportation. A lot of fuel is necessary to move people and goods around the country. Industry uses the most energy. Industrial uses account for one-third of all the energy used in the U.S. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Energy Resources</h3>
        <p>Figure 20.11 shows the energy resources used in the U.S. The U.S. depends mainly on fossil fuels. Petroleum is used more than any other resource. Renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind energy, could provide all the energy we need, but they are not yet widely used in the U.S. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Energy to Get Energy</h3>
        <p>We must use energy to get energy resources. This is true of non-renewable and renewable energy. Getting fossil fuels so that they can be used takes many steps. All of these steps use energy. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Fossil fuels must be found. The resources must be removed from the ground. These resources need to be refined, some more than others. Fossil fuels may need to be changed to a different form of energy. Energy resources must be transported from where they are produced to where they are sold or used. Consider petroleum as an example. Oil companies explore for petroleum in areas where they think it might be. When they find it, they must determine how much is there. They must also know how hard it will be to get. If theres enough to make it worthwhile, they will decide to go for it. To extract petroleum, companies they must build huge rigs, like the one in Figure 20.12. An oil rig drills deep into the ground and pumps the oil to the surface. The oil is then transported to a refinery. At the refinery, the oil is heated. It will then separate into different products, such as gasoline and motor oil. Finally, the oil products are transported to gas stations, stores, and industries. At every step, energy is used. For every five barrels of oil we use, it takes at least one barrel to get the oil. Less energy is needed to get renewable energy sources. Solar energy is a good example. Sunlight is everywhere, so no one needs to go out and find it. We dont have to drill for it or pump it to the surface. We just need to install solar panels like the ones in Figure 20.13 and let sunlight strike them. The energy from the sunlight is changed to electricity. The electricity is used to power lights and appliances in the house. So solar energy doesnt have to be transported. </p>

        <h3>Conserving Energy</h3>
        <p>Nonrenewable energy resources will run out before long. Using these energy resources also produces pollution and increases global warming. For all these reasons, we need to use less of these energy sources. We also need to use them more efficiently. </p>

        <h3>Using Less Energy</h3>
        <p>There are many ways to use less energy. Table 20.2 lists some of them. Can you think of other ways to use less energy? For example, how might schools use less energy? Use of Energy Transportation How to Use Less Plan ahead to reduce the number of trips you make. Take a bus or train instead of driving. Walk or bike rather than ride. Home Unplug appliances when not in use. Turn off lights when you leave a room. Put on a sweater instead of turning up the heat. Run the dishwasher and washing machine only when full. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Energy More Efficiently</h3>
        <p>We can get more work out of the energy we use. Table 20.3 show some ways to use energy more efficiently. By getting more bang for the buck, we wont need to use as much energy overall. Does your family use energy efficiently? How could you find out? Use of Energy More Efficient Use Another way to use energy more efficiently is with Energy Star appliances. They carry the Energy Star logo, shown in Figure 20.14. To be certified as Energy Star, the appliance must use less energy. Energy Star appliances save a lot of energy over their lifetime. What if millions of households used Energy Star appliances? How much energy would it save? </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>7. Write a public service announcement for your school. Encourage other students to conserve energy by reducing energy use. Include practical tips for using less energy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe how people use energy.
List ways to conserve energy.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>About half the energy used in the U.S. is used in homes and for transportation. Businesses, stores, and industry use the other half. The U.S. uses mainly fossil fuels. It takes energy to get energy. It takes more energy to get non-renewable than renewable energy. There are two basic ways to conserve energy. You can use less energy. You can also use energy more efficiently. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this chapter, you learned how people use natural resources such as fossil fuels. You also learned about ways to protect these natural resources. In the next chapter, youll learn about another important natural resource: water. What are some ways that humans use water? How do human actions endanger the water supply? How can the water supply can be protected? For Table 20.1, from left to right, top to bottom: User:Camelboy/Wikipedia. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2004MINICooperS-001.JPG . Public Domain.
