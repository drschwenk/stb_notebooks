        <h3>Photosynthesis</h3>
        <p>Most of the energy used by living things comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight provides the energy for photosynthesis. This is the process in which plants and certain other organisms (see Figure 9.26) synthesize glucose (C6 H12 O6 ). The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2 O + Light Energy ! C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules. Glucose is used for energy by the cells of almost all living things. Plants make their own glucose. Other organisms get glucose by consuming plants (or organisms that consume plants). How do living things get energy from glucose? The answer is cellular respiration. </p>

        <h3>Cellular Respiration</h3>
        <p>Cellular respiration is the process in which the cells of living things break down glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The overall chemical equation for cellular respiration is: C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 ! 6CO2 + 6H2 O + Heat and Chemical Energy Cellular respiration releases some of the energy in glucose as heat. It uses the rest of the energy to form many, even smaller molecules. The smaller molecules contain just the right amount of energy to power chemical reactions inside cells.

        <h3>Enzymes and Biochemical Reactions</h3>
        <p>Human body temperature must remain within a narrow range around 37C (98.6F). At this temperature, most biochemical reactions would occur too slowly to keep us alive. Thats where enzymes come in. Enzymes are biochemical catalysts. They speed up biochemical reactions, not only in humans but in virtually all living things. Most enzymes are proteins. Two are described in Figure 9.27. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Biochemical reactions are chemical reactions that take place inside living things. Two of the most important biochemical reactions are photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Photosynthesis is the process in which plants and certain other organisms synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water using light energy. Oxygen is also produced. Cellular respiration is the process in which the cells of living things break down glucose with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Enzymes are biochemical catalysts that speed up biochemical reactions. Without enzymes, most chemical reactions in living things would occur too slowly to keep organisms alive. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The enzyme pepsin works only in the presence of acid. A strong acid is secreted into the stomach. It provides the acid that pepsin needs. You will learn about acids in the next chapter, "Chemistry of Solutions." Vinegar and lemon juice are two common acids. What do you think are properties of acids? What other foods might contain acids? For Table 9.1, Lattice: User:Cadmium/Wikipedia. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alpha_po_lattice.jpg . Public Domain.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>All living things need energy. From running a marathon to just taking a breath, energy is required. Where does the energy come from? The answer is chemical reactions. Reactions that take place within living things are called biochemical reactions. Two of the most important are photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Together, these two processes provide energy to almost all of Earths organisms. Figure 9.25 and the video at the URL below show how the two processes are related. </p>
