        <h3>Solar Eclipses</h3>
        <p>A solar eclipse occurs when the new Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun (Figure 1.1). This casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks Earths view of the Sun. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun (Figure 1.2). When only a portion of the Sun is out of view, it is called a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare and usually only last a few minutes because the Moon casts only a small shadow (Figure 1.3). As the Sun is covered by the Moons shadow, it will actually get cooler outside. Birds may begin to sing, and stars will become visible in the sky. During a solar eclipse, the corona and solar prominences can be seen. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun in such a way that the Sun is either partially or totally hidden from view. Some people, including some scientists, chase eclipses all over the world to learn or just observe this amazing phenomenon. A solar eclipse shown as a series of pho- tos.

        <h3>Lunar Eclipse</h3>
        <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon moves through Earths shadow, which only happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun and all three are lined up in the same plane, called the ecliptic (Figure 1.4). In an eclipse, Earths shadow has two distinct parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow, in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Earths shadow where only part of the light is blocked. In the penumbra, the light is dimmed but not totally absent. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. Earths shadow is large enough that a lunar eclipse lasts for hours and can be seen by any part of Earth with a view of the Moon at the time of the eclipse (Figure 1.5). A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because Moons orbit is inclined 5-degrees to Earths orbit, so the two bodies are not in the same plane every month. </p>

        <p>During a solar eclipse, the new Moon passes between Earth and Sun. During a lunar eclipse, the full Moon moves through Earths shadow. The umbra is the part of the shadow in which light is completely blocked and the penumbra is the part of the shadow that is partially lit. </p>
