        <h3>Levels of Ecological Organization</h3>
        <p>Ecosystems can be studied at small levels or at large levels. The levels of organization are described below from the smallest to the largest: A species is a group of individuals that are genetically related and can breed to produce fertile young. Individuals are not members of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that can also have children. The second word in the two word name given to every organism is the species name. For example, in Homo sapiens, sapiens is the species name. A population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is composed of all of the biotic factors of an area. An ecosystem includes the living organisms (all the populations) in an area and the non-living aspects of the environment ( Figure 1.1). An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area. Satellite image of Australias Great Barrier Reef, an example of a marine ecosys- tem. The biosphere is the part of the planet with living organisms ( Figure 1.2). The biosphere includes most of Earth, including part of the oceans and the atmosphere. Ecologists study ecosystems at every level, from the individual organism to the whole ecosystem and biosphere. They can ask different types of questions at each level. Examples of these questions are given in Table 1.1, using the zebra (Equus zebra) as an example. Ecosystem Level Individual Population Community Ecosystem Question How do zebras keep water in their bodies? What causes the growth of a zebra populations? How does a disturbance, like a fire or predator, affect the number of mammal species in African grasslands? How does fire affect the amount of food available in grassland ecosystems? </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Levels of organization in ecology include the population, community, ecosystem, and biosphere. An ecosystem is all the living things in an area interacting with all of the abiotic parts of the environment. </p>
