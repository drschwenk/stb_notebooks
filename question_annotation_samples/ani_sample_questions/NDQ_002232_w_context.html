        <h3>Lunar Characteristics</h3>
        <p>The Moon is Earths only natural satellite. The Moon is about one-fourth the size of Earth, 3,476 kilometers in diameter. Gravity on the Moon is only one-sixth as strong as it is on Earth. If you weigh 120 pounds on Earth, you would only weigh 20 pounds on the Moon. You can jump six times as high on the Moon as you can on Earth. The Moon makes no light of its own. Like every other body in the solar system, it only reflects light from the Sun. The Moon rotates on its axis once for every orbit it makes around the Earth. What does this mean? This means that the same side of the Moon always faces Earth. The side of the Moon that always faces Earth is called the near side. The side of the Moon that always faces away from Earth is called the far side (Figure 24.13). All people for all time have only seen the Moons near side. The far side has only been seen by spacecraft. The Moon has no atmosphere. With no atmosphere, the Moon is not protected from extreme temperatures. The average surface temperature during the day is approximately 107C (225F). Daytime temperatures can reach as high as 123C (253F). At night, the average temperature drops to -153C (-243F). The lowest temperatures measured are as low as -233C (-397F). </p>

        <h3>The Lunar Surface</h3>
        <p>We all know what the Moon looks like. Its always looked the same during our lifetime. In fact, the Moon has looked the same to every person who has looked up at it for all time. Even the dinosaurs and trilobites, should they have looked up at it, would have seen the same thing. This is not true of Earth. Natural processes continually alter the Earths surface. Without these processes, would Earths surface resemble the Moons? Even though we cant see it from Earth, the Moon has changed recently too. Astronauts footprints are now on the Moon. They will remain unchanged for thousands of years, because there is no wind, rain, or living thing to disturb them. Only a falling meteorite could destroy them. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lunar Craters</h3>
        <p>The landscape of the Moon - its surface features - is very different from Earth. The lunar landscape is covered by craters caused by asteroid impacts (Figure 24.14). The craters are bowl-shaped basins on the Moons surface. Because the Moon has no water, wind, or weather, the craters remain unchanged. The Moons coldest temperatures are found deep in the craters. The coldest craters are at the south pole on the Moons far side, where the Sun never shines. These temperatures are amongst the coldest in our entire solar system. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lunar Maria</h3>
        <p>When you look at the Moon from Earth, you notice dark and light areas. The maria are dark, solid, flat areas of lava. Maria covers around 16% of the Moons surface, mostly on the near side. The maria formed about 3.0 to 3.5 billion years ago, when the Moon was continually bombarded by meteorites (Figure 24.15). Large meteorites broke through the Moons newly formed surface. This caused magma to flow out and fill the craters. Scientists estimate volcanic activity on the Moon ended about 1.2 billion years ago. The lighter parts on the Moon are called terrae, or highlands (Figure 24.15). They are higher than the maria and include several high mountain ranges. The rock that makes up the highlands is lighter in color and crystallized more slowly than the maria. The rock looks light because it reflects more of the Suns light. </p>

        <h3>Not Much Water</h3>
        <p>There are no lakes, rivers, or even small puddles anywhere to be found on the Moons surface. So there is no running water and no atmosphere. This means that there is no erosion. Natural processes continually alter the Earths surface. Without these processes, our planets surface would be covered with meteorite craters just like the Moon. Many moons in our solar system have cratered surfaces. NASA scientists have discovered a large number of water molecules mixed in with lunar dirt. There is also surface water ice. Even though there is a very small amount of water, there is no atmosphere. Temperatures are extreme. So it comes as no surprise that there has not been evidence of life on the Moon. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Interior of the Moon</h3>
        <p>Like Earth, the Moon has a distinct crust, mantle, and core. The crust is composed of igneous rock. This rock is rich in the elements oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. On the near side, the Moons crust is about 60 kilometers thick. On the far side, the crust is about 100 kilometers thick. The mantle is made of rock like Earths mantle. The Moon has a small metallic core, perhaps 600 to 800 kilometers in diameter. The composition of the core is probably mostly iron with some sulfur and nickel. We learned this both from the rock samples gathered by astronauts and from spacecraft sent to the Moon. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Why doesnt the Moon have an atmosphere? 5. Why is the crust thicker on the near side of the Moon than on the far side? 6. Why is the force of gravity weaker on the Moon than on Earth? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Find similarities and differences between Moon and Earth.
Describe the features of the Moon.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The evidence suggests that the Moon formed when a Mars sized planet collided with Earth. The Moon makes one rotation on its axis for each orbit around the Earth. The Moon has dark areas, called maria, surrounded by lighter colored highland areas, called terrae. Because the Moon is geologically inactive and doesnt have an atmosphere, it has many thousands of craters on its surface. The Moon is made of materials similar to Earth and has a crust, mantle and core, just like Earth. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>7. Why doesnt the Moon have much water? 8. One idea for how the Moon formed was presented in the Earths History chapter. Can you create another plausible hypothesis? 9. How much do landscape features on the Moon change over time compared to landscape features on Earth? Explain your answer. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>What things would be different on Earth if Earth did not have a Moon? If the Moon rotated on its axis twice as fast as it does now, would we see anything different than we do now? How do we know that the Moon has been geologically inactive for billions of years? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Between 1969 and 1972, six spaceships landed on the lunar surface. (Lunar means related to the moon.) The astronauts brought back soil and rock samples. Scientists have used modern methods to study these samples. Because of the Apollo missions, we have learned a great deal about the Moon. No astronauts have visited the Moon since 1972. There is talk of someday returning, but as of now there are no concrete plans. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What features does Earth have that the Moon does not? 2. How long will astronaut footprints remain on the Moon? 3. What is the difference between maria and terrae? </p>
