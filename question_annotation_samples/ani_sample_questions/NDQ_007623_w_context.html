        <h3>What Are Muscles</h3>
        <p>Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. Muscles are composed primarily of cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell, as you can see in Figure 16.16. It contains multiple nuclei and many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. It also contains many organelles called myofibrils. Myofibrils allow muscles to contract, or shorten. Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>How a Muscle Contracts</h3>
        <p>To understand how a muscle contracts, you need to dive deeper into the structure of muscle fibers. You can see in Figure 16.16 that a muscle fiber is full of myofibrils. Each myofibril is made up of two types of proteins, called actin and myosin. These proteins form thread-like filaments. The myosin filaments use energy from ATP to pull on the actin filaments. This causes the actin filaments to slide over the myosin filaments and shorten a section of the myofibril. You can see a simple animation of the process at this link: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Actin_Myosin.gif The sliding-and-shortening process occurs all along many myofibrils and in many muscle fibers. It causes the muscle fibers to shorten and the muscle to contract. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Muscle Tissue</h3>
        <p>There are three different types of muscle tissue in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. All three types consist mainly of muscle fibers, but the fibers have different arrangements. You can see how each type of muscle tissue looks in Figure 16.17. Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. It is striated, or striped, because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary. This means that they are not under conscious control. When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of other internal organs such as the stomach. It isnt striated because its muscle fibers are arranged in sheets rather than bundles. Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary. When smooth muscles in the stomach contract, they squeeze food inside the stomach. This helps break the food into smaller pieces. Skeletal muscle is attached to the bones of the skeleton. It is striated like cardiac muscle because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary. This means that they are under conscious control. Whether you are doing pushups or pushing a pencil, you are using skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are the most common type of muscles in the body. You can read more about them below. </p>

        <h3>A Closer Look at Skeletal Muscles</h3>
        <p>The human body has more than 600 skeletal muscles. You can see some of them in Figure 16.18. A few of the larger muscles are labeled in the figure. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure and Function of Skeletal Muscles</h3>
        <p>You can see the bundles of muscle fibers that make up a skeletal muscle in Figure 16.19. You can also see in the figure how the muscle is attached to a bone by a tendon. Tendons are tough connective tissues that anchor skeletal muscles to bones throughout the body. Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones where they meet at a joint. The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move. </p>

        <h3>Skeletal Muscles Work in Pairs</h3>
        <p>Muscles can only contract. They cant actively lengthen. Therefore, to move bones back and forth at a joint, skeletal muscles must work in pairs. For example, the bicep and triceps muscles of the upper arm work as a pair. You can see how this pair of muscles works in Figure 16.20. When the bicep muscle contracts, it bends the arm at the elbow. When the triceps muscle contracts, it straightens the arm. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Your Muscular System Healthy</h3>
        <p>Did you ever hear the saying, Use it or lose it? Thats certainly true when it comes to muscles. If you dont exercise your muscles, they will actually shrink in size. They will also become weaker and more prone to injury. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Keeping Muscles Strong</h3>
        <p>Exercising muscles increases their size, and bigger muscles have greater strength. What type of exercises should you do? For all-round muscular health, you should do two basic types of exercise. To increase the size and strength of skeletal muscles, you need to make these muscles contract against a resisting force. For example, you can do sit-ups or pushups, where the resisting force is your own body weight. You can see another way to do it in Figure 16.21. To exercise cardiac muscle and increase muscle endurance, you need to do aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise increases the size and strength of muscles in the heart and helps all your muscles develop greater endurance. This means they can work longer without getting tired. Aerobic exercise is any exercise such as running, biking, or swimming that causes an increase in your heart rate. You can see another example of aerobic exercise in Figure 16.22. Lifting weights is one way to pit skeletal muscles against a resisting force. Snowshoeing is a fun way to get aerobic exercise. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Preventing Muscle Injuries</h3>
        <p>You are less likely to have a muscle injury if you exercise regularly and have strong muscles. Stretching also helps prevent muscle injuries. Stretching improves the range of motion of muscles and tendons at joints. You should always warm up before stretching or doing any type of exercise. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to be injured. One way to warm up is to jog slowly for a few minutes. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. They consist primarily of long, thin cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull on actin filaments in myofibrils throughout the fiber. There are three types of muscle tissues: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons. Skeletal muscles work in pairs to move bones back and forth at joints. Regular resistance exercise and aerobic exercise, preceded by warming up and stretching, can help keep the muscular system strong and healthy. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>You may have heard that eating certain foods causes acne. This may or may not be true. But theres no question that what you eat is important for the health of your skin, bones, muscles. 1. Do you know how to eat for good health? 2. How do you choose healthy foods? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>You may think of muscles as the end result of exercises, like the pushups the soldier in Figure 16.15 is doing. Muscles in the arms and shoulders, which move the body, are easy to see and feel. However, they arent the only type of muscles. Many muscles are deep inside the body, mostly in the walls of organs. For example, your heart is almost completely muscle. These muscles dont directly move your body, but you couldnt survive without them. </p>
