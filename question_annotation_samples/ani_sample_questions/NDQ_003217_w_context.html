        <h3>How Do We Know About Earths Interior</h3>
        <p>If someone told you to figure out what is inside Earth, what would you do? How could you figure out what is inside our planet? How do scientists figure it out? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Seismic Waves</h3>
        <p>Geologists study earthquake waves to see Earths interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquakes focus. These are called seismic waves (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves change speed as they move through different materials. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. Scientists use all of this information to understand what makes up the Earths interior. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Meteorites</h3>
        <p>Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earths interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent early solar system materials. Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel. They are thought to be very similar to Earths core (Figure 6.2). An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands! </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <p>Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. Its understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers (Figure 6.3). Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Oceanic Crust</h3>
        <p>There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Continental Crust</h3>
        <p>Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks. All three major rock types  igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary  are found in the crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm3) than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mantle</h3>
        <p>Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects (Figure 6.4). The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards (Figure 6.5). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell. </p>

        <h3>Core</h3>
        <p>The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal from studying metallic meteorites and the Earths density. Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid, while the inner core is solid. Movement within Earths outer liquid iron core creates Earths magnetic field. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lithosphere and Asthenosphere</h3>
        <p>Lithosphere and asthenosphere are layers based on physical properties. The outermost layer is the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the crust and the uppermost mantle. In terms of physical properties, this layer is rigid, solid, and brittle. It is easily cracked or broken. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle. This layer is solid, but it can flow and bend. A solid that can flow is like silly putty. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Describe the properties of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. What parts of the Earth do these layers include? 5. When you put your hand near a pan above a pan filled with boiling water, does your hand warm up because of convection or conduction? If you touch the pan, does your hand warm up because of convection or conduction? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Compare and describe each of Earths layers.
Compare some of the ways geologists learn about Earths interior.
Define oceanic and continental crust and the lithosphere.
Describe how heat moves, particularly how convection takes place in the mantle.
Compare the two parts of the core and describe why they are different from each other.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The Earth is made of three layers with different composition: the crust, mantle, and core. The lithosphere is made of the rigid, brittle, solid crust and uppermost mantle. Beneath the lithosphere, the asthenosphere is solid rock that can flow. The hot core warms the base of the mantle, which creates convection currents in the mantle. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>6. List two reasons that scientists know that the outer core is liquid. 7. Suppose that Earths interior contains a large amount of lead. Lead is very dense: 11.34 g/cm3 . Would the lead be more likely to be found in the crust, mantle, or core? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The oceanic crust is thinner and denser than continental crust. All crust sits atop the mantle. What might our planet be like if this were not true. If sediments fall onto the seafloor over time, what can sediment thickness tell scientists about the age of the seafloor in different regions? How might convection cells in the mantle affect the movement of plates of lithosphere on the planets surface? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>From outside to inside, Earth is divided into crust, mantle, and core. Each has a different chemical makeup. Earth can also be divided into layers with different properties. The two most important are lithosphere and asthenosphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. List two ways that scientists learn about what makes up the Earths interior. 2. What type of rock makes up the oceanic crust? 3. What types of rock make up the continental crust? </p>
