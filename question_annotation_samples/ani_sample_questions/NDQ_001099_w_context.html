        <h3>What Are Storms</h3>
        <p>A storm is an episode of severe weather caused by a major disturbance in the atmosphere. Storms can vary a lot in the time they last and in how severe they are. A storm may last for less than an hour or for more than a week. It may affect just a few square kilometers or thousands. Some storms are harmless and some are disastrous. The size and strength of a storm depends on the amount of energy in the atmosphere. Greater differences in temperature and air pressure produce stronger storms. Types of storms include thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter storms such as blizzards. </p>

        <h3>Thunderstorms</h3>
        <p>Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning. In strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are also likely. Thunderstorms are very common. Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each year! In the U.S., they are most common and strongest in the Midwest. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>What Causes Thunderstorms</h3>
        <p>Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid. The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts. When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses. The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder- heads. You can see one in Figure 16.12. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lightning and Thunder</h3>
        <p>During a thunderstorm, some parts of a thunderhead become negatively charged. Other parts become positively charged. The difference in charge creates lightning. Lightning is a huge release of electricity. Lightning can jump between oppositely charged parts of the same cloud, between one cloud and another, or between a cloud and the ground. You can see lightning in Figure 16.13. Lightning blasts the air with energy. The air heats and expands so quickly that it explodes. This creates the loud sound of thunder. Do you know why you always hear the boom of thunder after you see the flash of lightning? Its because light travels faster than sound. If you count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder, you can estimate how far away the lightning was. A lapse of 5 seconds is equal to about a mile. </p>

        <h3>Tornadoes</h3>
        <p>Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds. This allows them to produce tornadoes. A tornado is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds. You can see a tornado in Figure 16.14. The funnel moves along the ground, destroying everything in its path. As it moves it loses energy. Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles). Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Classifying Tornadoes</h3>
        <p>The winds of a tornado can reach very high speeds. The faster the winds blow, the greater the damage they cause. Wind speed and damage are used to classify tornadoes. Table 16.1 shows how. F Scale F0 (km/hr) 64-116 (mph) 40-72 F1 117-180 73-112 Damage Light - tree branches fall and chimneys may col- lapse Moderate - mobile homes, autos pushed aside F Scale F2 (km/hr) 181-253 (mph) 113-157 F3 254-332 158-206 F4 333-419 207-260 F5 420-512 261-318 F6 >512 >318 Damage Considerable - roofs torn off houses, large trees up- rooted Severe - houses torn apart, trees uprooted, cars lifted Devastating - houses lev- eled, cars thrown Incredible - structures fly, cars become missiles Maximum tornado wind speed </p>

        <h3>Tornado Alley</h3>
        <p>Look at the map in Figure 16.15. It shows where the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes can happen almost anywhere in the U.S. but only this area is called tornado alley. Why do so many tornadoes occur here? This is where warm air masses from the south run into cold air masses from the north. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Hurricanes</h3>
        <p>Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes. A hurricane is an enormous storm with high winds and heavy rains. Hurricanes may be hundreds of kilometers wide. They may travel for thousands of kilometers. The storms wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour. Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones. Hurricanes form over warm very ocean water. This water gives them their energy. As long as a hurricane stays over the warm ocean, it keeps growing stronger. However, if it goes ashore or moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy. The storm then loses strength and slowly fades away. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Eye of a Hurricane</h3>
        <p>At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and clear. This is the eye of the hurricane. The eye forms at the low-pressure center of the hurricane. You can see the eye of a hurricane in Figure 16.16. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Classifying Hurricanes</h3>
        <p>Like tornadoes, hurricanes are classified on the basis of wind speed and damage. Table 16.2 shows how. Category 1 (weak) Kph 119-153 Mph 74-95 2 (moderate) 154-177 96-110 3 (strong) 178-209 111-130 Damage Above normal; no real damage to structures Some roofing, door, and window damage, consid- erable damage to vegeta- tion, mobile homes, and piers Some buildings damaged; mobile homes destroyed Category 4 (very strong) Kph 210-251 Mph 131-156 5 (devastating) >251 >156 Damage Complete roof failure on small residences; major erosion of beach areas; major damage to lower floors of structures near shore Complete roof failure on many residences and in- dustrial buildings; some complete building failures </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Storm Surge</h3>
        <p>Some of the damage from a hurricane is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land. You can see this in Figure 16.17. High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Winter Storms</h3>
        <p>Like hurricanes, winter storms develop from cyclones. But in the case of winter storms, the cyclones form at higher latitudes. In North America, cyclones often form when the jet stream dips south in the winter. This lets dry polar air pour south. At the same time, warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico flows north. When the two air masses meet, the differences in temperature and pressure cause strong winds and heavy precipitation. Two types of winter storms that occur in the U.S. are blizzards and lake-effect snow storms. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Blizzards</h3>
        <p>A blizzard is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow. You can see a blizzard in Figure 16.18. Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends on air temperature and wind speed, as you can see in Figure 16.19. Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>LakeEffect Snow</h3>
        <p>Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake- effect snow. Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs. Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other side, the air cools. Since there was so much moisture in the air it can drop a lot of snow. More than 254 centimeters (100 inches) of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm! </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A storm is an episode of severe weather. It is caused by a major disturbance in the atmosphere. Types of storms include thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. A thunderstorm is a storm with heavy rains and lightning. It may also have hail and high winds. Thunderstorms are very common. They occur when the air is very warm and humid. A tornado is a storm with a funnel-shaped cloud. It has very strong, whirling winds. Tornadoes are small but powerful. They occur with thunderstorms and hurricanes. A hurricane is a large storm with high winds and heavy rains. Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones. They form over warm ocean water. Much of the damage from hurricanes may be caused by storm surge. Winter storms develop from cyclones at higher latitudes. They include blizzards and lake-effect snow storms. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused a huge flood in the city of New Orleans. Figure 16.11 shows what the city looked like after the hurricane. Mile after mile of homes and businesses were covered with flood water. Billions of dollars of damage were done. More than 2,000 people died. Hurricanes are extremely strong storms and Katrina was stronger than most. What are storms? What causes them? And what gives a storm its strength? Read on to find out. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Define storm. List three types of storms. 2. Why do thunderstorms occur? 3. What is lightning? What causes it? 4. Where is tornado alley? Why do so many tornadoes occur there? 5. Where do hurricanes form? Where do they get their energy? </p>
