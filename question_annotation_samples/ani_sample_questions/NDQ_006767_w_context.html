        <h3>Plant Responses</h3>
        <p>Instead of fleeing, a plants primary way of responding is to change how it is growing. One way is by tropisms. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Plant Tropisms</h3>
        <p>A tropism is a turning toward, or away from, a stimulus in the environment. Examples of tropisms in plants include gravitropism and phototropism. You can see both tropisms in action in this amazing time-lapse video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Gravitropism is a response to gravity. Plant roots always grow downward because of the pull of Earths gravity. Specialized cells in the tips of plant roots detect and respond to gravity in this way. Phototropism is a response to light. Plant stems and leaves grow toward a light source. The house plant in Figure 10.23 shows the effects of phototropism. The plant receives light mainly from the left so it grows in that direction. </p>

        <h3>Daily and Seasonal Responses of Plants</h3>
        <p>Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter. Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off (see Figure 10.24). Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Plant Responses to Disease</h3>
        <p>Plants dont have an immune system, but they do respond to disease. Typically, their first line of defense is the death of cells surrounding infected tissue. This prevents the infection from spreading. Many plants also produce hormones and toxins to fight pathogens. For example, willow trees, like the one in Figure Exciting new research suggests that plants may even produce chemicals that warn other, nearby plants of threats to their health. The warnings allow nearby plants to prepare for their own defense. As these and other responses show, plants may be rooted in place, but they are far from helpless. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Plants with Special Adaptations</h3>
        <p>Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions. Some plants have evolved special adaptations that let them live in extreme environments. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Aquatic Plants</h3>
        <p>All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants today have land-plant ancestors. But some plants now live in the water. They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat. Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants. Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. Theres plenty of it and its all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants. Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isnt feasible under water. Sunlight also cant penetrate very far below the water surface. Thats why some aquatic plants have adaptations that help them keep their flowers and leaves above water. An example is the water lily, shown in Figure 10.26. The water lily has bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams or rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, the cattails shown in Figure 10.26 have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to moving water. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Xerophytes</h3>
        <p>Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water. Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes. Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when its available. The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 10.27 has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesnt have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside. </p>

        <h3>Epiphytes</h3>
        <p>Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests. Host trees provide support for the plants. They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor. This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores. In addition, it may increase the chances of pollination by wind. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carnivorous Plants</h3>
        <p>Carnivorous plants are plants that get some or most of their nutrients (but not energy or carbon compounds) from other organisms. They trap and digest insects or other small animals or protozoa. However, they still need sunlight in order to make food by photosynthesis. Carnivorous plants have adapted to grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients. They are found in places such as bogs and rock outcroppings.

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Many modern medicines have been discovered in trees and other plants. Why do you think so many disease- fighting compounds are found in plants? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how plants respond to stimuli in their environment.
Identify special adaptations in plants.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A plants main response to stimuli in its environment is to change how it is growing. For example, plant roots grow toward Earths gravity. Stems and leaves bend toward sunlight. Plants also respond to daily and seasonal changes and to disease. Some plants have evolved special adaptations to extreme environments. Such plants include aquatic plants, xerophytes, epiphytes, and carnivorous plants. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>5. Identify two challenges faced by aquatic plants. Explain how they have evolved to adapt to the challenges. 6. Carnivorous plants are classified as producers. Why arent they classified as consumers? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Like plants, animals are multicellular eukaryotes. However, animals differ from plants in other important ways. 1. What are some ways that animals differ from plants? 2. The most basic division of plants is between vascular and nonvascular plants. How are animals divided? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Like all living things, plants detect and respond to stimuli in their environment. Unlike animals, plants cant run, fly, or swim toward food or away from danger. They are usually rooted firmly in the soil, like the tree in Figure 10.22. </p>
