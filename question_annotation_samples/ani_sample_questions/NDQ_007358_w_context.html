        <h3>What Is a Primate</h3>
        <p>A primate is a mammal in the Primate Order of placental mammals. In addition to human beings, this order consists of lemurs, tarsiers, monkeys, and apes. It includes mammals that range in size from the tiny mouse lemur, which weighs only 30 g (about an ounce), to the majestic gorilla, an ape that may weigh as much as 200 kg (440 lb). Both a mouse lemur and gorilla are pictured in Figure 14.19. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Primate Groups</h3>
        <p>Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates. Primates called prosimians are generally smaller. There are also far fewer of them. Prosimians include lemurs, such as the mouse lemur in Figure 14.19, and lorises. Prosimians are thought to be more similar to the earliest primates. All other primates are non-prosimian primates. They are placed in groups that include tarsiers, New World (Central and South America) monkeys, Old World (Africa and Asia) monkeys, apes, and humans. You can see examples of non-prosimian primates in Figure 14.20. </p>

        <h3>Primate Traits</h3>
        <p>A number of traits set primates apart from other orders of placental mammals. Primates evolved from tree-living, or arboreal, ancestors. As a result, many primate traits are adaptations for life in the trees. Living in trees requires good grasping ability. Being able to judge distances is also important. Primates have five digits (fingers or toes) on each extremity. Unlike the hooves of horses or the paddles of whales, the digits of primates are relatively unspecialized. Therefore, they can be used to do a variety of tasks, including grasping branches and holding tools. Most primates have opposable thumbs. An opposable thumb can be brought into opposition with the other fingers of the same hand. This allows the hand to grasp and hold things. Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell, which is the dominant sense in many other mammals. The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye. Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic (3-D) vision, needed for judging distances. Some primates, including humans, have also evolved color vision. Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals. This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors. Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals their size. They reach maturity later and have longer lifespans. Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders. </p>

        <h3>Primate Habitats and Diets</h3>
        <p>Except for humans and a few other species, most modern primates still live in trees at least some of the time. They live primarily in tropical rain forests of Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Some primates, such as the gibbon in Figure 14.21, have long arms and curving fingers that allow them to swing from branch to branch high up in trees. This way of traveling is called brachiation. You can watch a gibbon brachiating in this amazing video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Fruit is the preferred food for almost all primates except humans. However, most primate species are omnivorous and consume a variety of plant and animal foods. For example, they may eat leaves, seeds, bird eggs, insects, and other small animals. Chimpanzees may band together and hunt for animals to kill and eat. They may even sharpen sticks and use them as spears when they hunt.

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Why do you think stereoscopic vision is important to an animal that brachiates? What activities do you do for which stereoscopic vision is important? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Define primates, and identify primate traits.
Describe primate habitats and diets.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A primate is a mammal in the Primate Order of placental mammals. Primates include lemurs, lorises, tarsiers, New and Old World monkeys, apes, and humans. Primate traits, such as five digits on each extremity and stereoscopic vision, may reflect their arboreal origins. Most modern primates, except for humans, live in tropical rainforests. Most also subsist on an omnivorous diet. They may prefer fruit but also consume a variety of other plant and animal foods. </p>

        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>5. Compare and contrast prosimian and non-prosimian primates. 6. Relate the rate of primate development to the importance of learning in primates. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Mammals in general and primates in particular are noted for their ability to learn. 1. Are mammals the only animals that can learn? 2. How do animals learn new behaviors? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In many ways, humans are unique among mammals. For example, we have bigger brains and a greater ability to learn than any other species in the mammalian class. In many ways, however, we are typical of the mammalian order to which we belong. That order is the Primate Order. To fully understand what it means to be human, you need to know more about this fascinating order of mammals. </p>
