        <h3>Blizzards</h3>
        <p>A blizzard is distinguished by certain conditions: Temperatures below -7 C (20 F); -12 C (10 F) for a severe blizzard. Winds greater than 56 kmh (35 mph); 72 kmh (45 mph) for a severe blizzard. Snow so heavy that visibility is 2/5 km (1/4 mile) or less for at least three hours; near zero visibility for a severe blizzard. </p>

        <h3>Formation</h3>
        <p>Blizzards happen across the middle latitudes and toward the poles, usually as part of a mid-latitude cyclone. Bliz- zards are most common in winter, when the jet stream has traveled south and a cold, northern air mass comes into contact with a warmer, semitropical air mass (Figure 1.2). The very strong winds develop because of the pressure gradient between the low-pressure storm and the higher pressure west of the storm. Snow produced by the storm gets caught in the winds and blows nearly horizontally. Blizzards can also produce sleet or freezing rain. A blizzard obscures the Capitol in Wash- ington, DC. Blizzard snows blanket the East Coast of the United States in February 2010. </p>

        <h3>LakeEffect Snow</h3>
        <p>In winter, a continental polar air mass travels down from Canada. As the frigid air travels across one of the Great Lakes, it warms and absorbs moisture. When the air mass reaches the leeward side of the lake, it is very unstable and it drops tremendous amounts of snow. This lake-effect snow falls on the snowiest metropolitan areas in the United States: Buffalo and Rochester, New York (Figure 1.3). Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Blizzards are often part of a mid-latitude cyclone where the jet stream brings cold air into contact with warm moist air. The difference in pressure between the air masses brings about strong winds. Cold polar air absorbs moisture as it travels over the Great Lakes and then dumps it as snow downwind to create lake-effect snow. </p>
