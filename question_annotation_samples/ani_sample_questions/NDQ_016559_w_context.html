        <h3>Speed of Light and Matter Advanced Topic</h3>
        <p>You have probably heard of the famous equation E = mc2 . The "E" represent the amount of energy. The "m" represents mass. The "c" represent the speed of light. Writing a "c" is much easier than writing the actual speed of light. The speed of light is a really large number. The speed of light is about 300 million meters per second. Thats really, really fast. Light always travels at the same speed through space. In outer space, there is not any matter to get in its way. Think about riding your bicycle. When you ride on a hard surface, it is easy to pedal. You can go really fast. Imagine how your speed would change if you were riding through deep sand. You would find it hard to pedal. You would not be able to go as fast. The same is true for light. When there is no matter around, like in outer space, it can go fast. When matter gets in its way, it slows down. Light travels through some matter faster than through others. Table 1.1 gives the speed of light in six common materials. Material Air Water Glass Vegetable oil Alcohol Diamond Speed of Light (m/s) 299 million meters per second 231 million meters per second 200 million meters per second 150 million meters per second 140 million meters per second 125 million meters per second No matter how slow light travels, it still goes really, really fast. The important thing to remember is that it does travel. It is hard for us to imagine light taking time to cover a distance. Think about when you enter your science classroom. You step through the door. You tell your teacher, "Hello." You walk to your desk and sit down. It may take around 10 to 20 seconds to walk this distance. Imagine now your teacher turns the light off. She carries a small lamp over to the door you just entered. She asks you to watch carefully as she switches on the light. She flips the switch and you immediately see the light. The light just covered the same distance you just walked. Thats how fast light is. For us, it is hard to imagine that it moves. Now lets think about light traveling between the Sun and Earth. The Sun is 93 million miles away. What if we were able to turn off the Sun for just a second? How long would it take us to notice? Would we notice instantly like in the classroom? Remember, the Sun is a long way away. We wouldnt notice the change for a little over 8 minutes. That is because the Sun is a long way away. Even when moving as fast as light, it takes time to travel from the Sun to Earth. What do you think happens when it hits the air in our atmosphere? Air is made up of matter. When light travels through matter it slows down. How do scientists know it slows down? What evidence do scientists have? When sunlight hits Earths atmosphere it bends just a little. If sunlight goes through water droplets it bends even more. The bending of light through droplets of water is why we can see rainbows. It also explains why the straw in a glass of water appears to be broken. </p>

        <h3>Bending Light</h3>
        <p>When light passes from one medium (or type of matter) to another, it changes speed. You can actually see this happen. If light strikes a new substance at an angle, the light appears to bend. This is what explains the straw looking broken in the picture above. So, does light always bend as it travels into a new medium? If light travels straight into a new substance it is not bent. You may know this angle as perpendicular. The light still slows down, just does not appear to bend. Any angle other than perpendicular the light will bend as it slows down. The bending of light is called refraction. Figure 1.1 shows how refraction occurs. Notice that the angle of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air. In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed explanation of refraction, watch this video: Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Demonstrate that light travels in a straight line until it strikes an object or travels from one medium to another.
Demonstrate that light can be reflected, refracted, and absorbed.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Light always travels at the same speed through empty space. The speed of light is about 300 million meters per second. When light travels through matter, it travels more slowly. If light passes from one type of matter to another at an angle, the light changes speed and bends. This bending of light is called refraction. The amount at which light refracts depends on the type of matter it enters. </p>
