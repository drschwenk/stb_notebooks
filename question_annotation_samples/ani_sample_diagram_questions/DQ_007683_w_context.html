        <h3>What Is the Immune System</h3>
        <p>The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. It has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system is shown in Figure 21.13. It includes several organs and a network of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that normally leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. When inflammation occurs, more lymph leaks into tissues, and the lymph is likely to contain pathogens. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 21.13 Parts of the immune system</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Organs of the Immune System</h3>
        <p>Immune system organs include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells called lymphocytes. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone. It stores some types of lymphocytes while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the lungs. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Circulation of Lymph</h3>
        <p>Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. However, lymph vessels circulate lymph instead of blood, and the heart does not pump lymph through the vessels. Lymph that collects in tissues slowly passes into tiny lymph vessels. Lymph then travels from smaller to larger lymph vessels. Muscles around the lymph vessels contract and squeeze the lymph through the vessels. The lymph vessels also contract to help move the lymph along. Eventually, lymph reaches the main lymph vessels, which are located in the chest. From these vessels, lymph drains into two large veins of the cardiovascular system. This is how lymph returns to the blood. Before lymph reaches the bloodstream, it passes through small oval structures called lymph nodes, which are located along the lymph vessels. Figure 21.14 shows where some of the bodys many lymph nodes are concentrated. Lymph nodes act like filters and remove pathogens from lymph. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lymphocytes</h3>
        <p>A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells. It is these antigens that trigger an immune response. </p>

        <h3>Immune Responses</h3>
        <p>There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>How B Cells Respond</h3>
        <p>B cells respond to pathogens in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped molecule that binds to an antigen. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen. The antibody and antigen fit together like a lock and key. You can see how this works in Figure 21.16. The antibody in the figure can bind only with the type of antigen that is colored yellow. Once the antibody binds with the antigen, it signals a phagocyte to engulf and destroy them, along with the pathogen that carries the antigen on its surface.

        </p>
        <h3>How T Cells Respond</h3>
        <p>There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. Figure 21.17 shows how a killer T cells destroys an infected cell. When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases toxins. The toxins make tiny holes in the infected cells membrane. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. However, they are still needed for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Immunity and Vaccination</h3>
        <p>Most B cells and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells Memory cells allow the immune system to remember a pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight it. They will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to fight off and resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity. You dont have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system includes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph. White blood cells called lymphocytes are the key cells involved in an immune response. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. B cells respond to pathogens in the blood and lymph by making antibodies against them. Killer T cells kill infected, damaged, or cancerous cells. Helper T cells release chemicals that control other lymphocytes. Immunity is the ability of the immune system to launch a rapid attack against a particular pathogen because it remembers it. Immunity prevents the pathogen from making you sick. It can come about by having a prior infection with the pathogen or by receiving a vaccination for it. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the same of the organs in the human body that are involved in the immune system. The organs shown here include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils and the adenoids. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone. It stores some types of white blood cells while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the thymus gland. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat and is located above the thymus gland. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose. The lymph nodes are present in the head just below the jaw. They are also located under the armpits and in the groin area. Lymph nodes act like filters and remove pathogens from lymph. Lymph vessels make up a circulatory system that is similar to the blood vessels of the cardiovascular system. However, lymph vessels circulate lymph instead of blood.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the main parts of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the circulatory system and a vital part of the immune system, comprising a network of lymphatic vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph directionally towards the heart. The lymphatic system also functions as a defense mechanism in the immune system. A lymph node is an oval- or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, present widely throughout the body including the armpit (axillary), pelvic, lumbar and stomach and linked by lymphatic vessels. Lymph nodes are major sites of B, T, and other immune cells called Lymphocytes. Lymphocytes are concentrated in the lymph nodes. The spleen and the thymus are also lymphoid organs of the immune system. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells.</p>
