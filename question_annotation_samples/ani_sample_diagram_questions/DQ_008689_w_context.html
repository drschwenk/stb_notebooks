        <h3>Types of Organisms and Energy</h3>
        <p>Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy. Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food. Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Producers</h3>
        <p>Producers are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy. Producers are also called autotrophs. There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. Photoautotrophs use energy in sunlight to make organic compounds by photosynthesis. They include plants, algae, and some bacteria (see Figure 24.1). Chemoautotrophs use energy in chemical compounds to make organic compounds. This process is called chemosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs include certain bacteria and archaea. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Consumers</h3>
        <p>Consumers are organisms that depend on other living things for food. They take in organic compounds by eating or absorbing other living things. Consumers include all animals and fungi. They also include some bacteria and protists. Consumers are also called heterotrophs. There are several different types of heterotrophs depending on exactly what they consume. They may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Herbivores are heterotrophs that consume producers such as plants or algae. Examples include rabbits and snails. Carnivores are heterotrophs that consume animals. Examples include lions and frogs. Omnivores are heterotrophs that consume both plants and animals. They include crows and human beings. The grizzly bears pictured in Figure 24.2 are also omnivores. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Decomposers</h3>
        <p>Decomposers are heterotrophs that break down the wastes of other organisms or the remains of dead organisms. When they do, they release simple inorganic molecules back into the environment. Producers can then use the inorganic molecules to make new organic compounds. For this reason, decomposers are essential to every ecosystem. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Organic wastes and dead organisms would pile up everywhere, and their nutrients would no longer be recycled. Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down. They may be scavengers, detritivores, or saprotrophs. Scavengers are decomposers that consume the soft tissues of dead animals. Examples of scavengers include hyenas and cockroaches. Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water. Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish. You can see another example in Figure 24.3. Saprotrophs are decomposers that feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work. Examples of saprotrophs include fungi and protozoa. </p>

        <h3>Modeling the Flow of Energy</h3>
        <p>Energy flows through ecosystems from producers, to consumers, to decomposers. Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model this flow of energy. They represent feeding relationships by showing who eats whom. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Food Chains</h3>
        <p>A food chain is a diagram that represents a single pathway through which energy flows through an ecosystem. Food chains are generally simpler than what really happens in nature. Thats because most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species. You can see examples of terrestrial and aquatic food chains in Figure 24.4. See if you can construct a food chain of each type by playing the animation at this link: </p>

        <h3>Food Webs</h3>
        <p>A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem. It includes a number of intersecting food chains. Food webs are generally more similar to what really happens in nature. They show that most organisms consume and are consumed by multiple species. You can see an example of a food web in Figure 24.5. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Trophic Levels</h3>
        <p>Each food chain or food web has organisms at different trophic levels. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or web. The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels, but they rarely have more than four trophic levels. The trophic levels are: 1. 2. 3. 4. Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. For example, the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers. Therefore, they feed at trophic levels 2 and 3. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Trophic Levels and Energy</h3>
        <p>Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels. However, only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is passed up the next level. This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure 24.6. The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web. There isnt enough energy left to support additional levels. It also explains why ecosystems need a constant input of energy. You can learn more about ecological pyramids in this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Trophic Levels and Biomass</h3>
        <p>Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well. This is also represented in the pyramid in Figure 24.6. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels. However, their smaller numbers result in less biomass. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how living things are classified based on the way they obtain energy.
Show how food chains and food webs model the flow of energy through ecosystems.
Identify trophic levels, and state how they are related to energy and biomass.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>All ecosystems need a constant input of energy in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds. Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy as producers, consumers, or decomposers. Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model the flow of energy through ecosystems. They show who eats whom. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or food web. Most food chains and webs have a maximum of four trophic levels. There is less energy and biomass at higher trophic levels. </p>

        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>5. Compare and contrast three types of decomposers. 6. Explain why food chains and webs rarely have more than four trophic levels. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Energy must constantly be added to an ecosystem for use by organisms. Matter, on the other hand, is continuously recycled through ecosystems. 1. Give an example of a cycle of matter. 2. What role do living things play in this cycle? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Energy is the ability to change or move matter. All living things need energy. They need energy for everything they do, whether it is to move long distances or simply to carry out basic biochemical processes inside cells. Energy enters most ecosystems in the form of sunlight. In a few ecosystems, energy enters in the form of chemical compounds. All ecosystems need a constant input of energy in one of these two forms. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Identify three major categories of living things based on how they obtain energy. 2. What is a food chain? Why are food chains simpler than actual feeding relationships in nature? 3. Define trophic level. How does an organism at trophic level 2 obtain energy? 4. At which trophic levels are you consuming when you eat a cheeseburger and French fries? </p>

        <p>A food chain diagram shows the energy flow through ecosystems. It represents feeding relationships. Producers are living organisms that produce food for other species. The producer in this diagram is the plant. Consumers are organisms that depend on other living things for food. The primary consumers of the plant are the mice, caterpillars and aphids. They in turn are the food for the secondary consumers. The secondary consumers in this diagram are the owl, the kookaburra and the sparrow. The eagle is the tertiary consumer in this diagram. Most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species so food chain diagrams are usually simpler than what happens in nature.</p>

        <p>The diagram we observe is that of a food web. A food web is nothing but a system of interlocking and interdependent food chains. In this food web, we observe 2 plants/fruits at the lowest level, namely Plantain and Berries. Plantain is consumed by Grasshoppers, Rabbits and Mouse. Berries on the other hand are consumed by Grasshoppers again, Titmouse, Butterflies and Greenflies. In the next level of the food web, the Grasshoppers are eaten by frogs, Rabbits and Mouse by Buzzard and Fox, Greenfly by Ladybird, Butterfly by Frogs and Titmouse by Snakes. The Ladybird is eaten by Dragonfly and the Dragonfly in turn is eaten by Frogs. The Frogs are consumed by Snakes and the Snake in turn is eaten by Buzzard. The Fox and Buzzard also feed on Titmouse, thus making them the topmost in the food web.</p>

        <p>Energy is the ability to change or move matter. Every living thing needs energy to survive and grow. Food chains such as this one here have many intersecting pathways. Realistically in nature, many plants and animals are eaten by a number of other such living things. As you can see in this diagram, rabbits, mice and grasshoppers all eat the grass. Additionally, hawks eat snakes, sparrows and frogs. This is all the natural way of life and exhibits the term survival of the fittest. This term means that the more dominant consumer will survive.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows an example of a food web. A food web shows the different pathways energy flows through an ecosystem. Because plants produce their own food as well as food for animals, they are called producers. Because animals eat other living things, they are called consumers. There are different kinds of animals based on what they consume. Animals that consume plants are called herbivores. Animals that consume other animals are called carnivores. Animals that consume both plants and animals are called omnivores. There are many food chains in a food web. A food chain shows how energy flows from a producer, to a primary consumer, then to a secondary consumer, then to a tertiary consumer, and so on, until it reaches the top of the food chain. For example, the diagram shows that plants, the producers, are eaten by herbivorous insects, the primary consumers. The herbivorous insects are then eaten by insectivorous birds, the secondary consumers. Finally, the insectivorous birds are eaten by hawks and owls, the tertiary consumers.</p>

        <p>This diagram exhibits the flow of energy concept. As seen the hawk eats the snake, mouse and decomposers. Additionally, the deer eat decomposers and trees to survive. The mouse is eaten by snakes, hawks and owls. The owl eats the frog which eats the cricket which eats decomposers. This is part of the cycle of life. Therefore, an ecosystem is depicted. An ecosystem is a group of living things living in their habitat.</p>
