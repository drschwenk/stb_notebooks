        <h3>Functions of the Nervous System</h3>
        <p>Controlling muscles and maintaining balance are just two of the functions of the human nervous system. What else does the nervous system do? It senses the surrounding environment with sense organs that include the eyes and ears. It senses the bodys own internal environment, including its temperature. It controls internal body systems to make sure the body maintains homeostasis. It prepares the body to fight or flee in the case of an emergency. It allows thinking, learning, memory, and language. Remember Hakeem the skater from the first page of the chapter? When Hakeem started to fall off the railing, his nervous system sensed that he was losing his balance. It responded by sending messages to his muscles. Some muscles contracted while other relaxed. As a result, Hakeem gained his balance again. How did his nervous system accomplish all of this in just a split second? You need to know how the nervous system transmits messages to answer that question. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Neurons and Nerve Impulses</h3>
        <p>The nervous system is made up of nerves. A nerve is a bundle of nerve cells. A nerve cell that carries messages is called a neuron. The messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. A nerve impulse can travel very quickly because it is an electrical signal. Think about flipping on a light switch when you enter a room. When you flip the switch, electricity flows to the light through wires inside the walls. The electricity may have to travel many meters to reach the light. Nonetheless, the light still comes on as soon as you flip the switch. Nerve impulses travel just as quickly through the network of nerves inside the body. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure of a Neuron</h3>
        <p>The structure of a neuron suits it for its function of transmitting nerve impulses. You can see what a neuron looks like in Figure 20.2. It has a special shape that lets it pass electrical signals to and from other cells. A neuron has three main parts: cell body, dendrites, and axon. 1. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. 2. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites. 3. The axon passes on the nerve impulses to other cells. It branches at the end into multiple nerve endings so it can transmit impulses to many other cells. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Types of Neurons</h3>
        <p>There are three basic types of neurons: sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons. All three types must work together to receive and respond to information. 1. Sensory neurons transmit nerve impulses from sense organs and internal organs to the brain via the spinal cord. In other words, they carry information about the inside and outside environment to the brain. 2. Motor neurons transmit nerve impulses from the brain via the spinal cord to internal organs, glands, and muscles. In other words, they carry information from the brain to the body, telling the body how to respond. 3. Interneurons carry nerve impulses back and forth between sensory and motor neurons. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Synapse</h3>
        <p>The nerve endings of an axon dont actually touch the dendrites of other neurons. The messages must cross a tiny gap between the two neurons, called the synapse. Chemicals called neurotransmitters carry the message across this gap. When a nerve impulse arrives at the end of an axon, neurotransmitters are released. They travel across the synaptic gap to a dendrite of another neuron. The neurotransmitters bind to the membrane of the dendrite, triggering a nerve impulse in the next neuron. You can see how this works in Figure 20.3 and in this animation:  The transmission of nerve impulses between neurons is like the passing of a baton between runners in a relay race. After the first runner races, she passes the baton to the second runner. Then the second runner takes over. Instead of a baton, a neuron passes neurotransmitters to the next neuron. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Central Nervous System</h3>
        <p>The nervous system has two main parts, called the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system is described later in this lesson. The central nervous system is shown in Figure 20.4. It includes the brain and spinal cord. </p>

        <h3>The Amazing Human Brain</h3>
        <p>The human brain is an amazing organ. It is the most complex organ in the human body. By adulthood, the brain weighs about 3 pounds and consists of billions of neurons. All those cells need a lot of energy. In fact, the adult brain uses almost a quarter of the total energy used by the body! The brain serves as the control center of the nervous system and the body as a whole. It lets us understand what we see, hear, or sense in other ways. It allows us to learn, think, remember, and use language. It controls all the organs and muscles in our body. </p>

        <h3>Parts of the Brain</h3>
        <p>The brain consists of three major parts, called the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. You can see these three parts of the brain in Figure 20.5. You can use this interactive animation to explore these parts of the brain: http://s 1. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It controls conscious functions, such as thinking, sensing, speaking, and voluntary muscle movements. Whether you are chatting with a friend or playing a video game, you are using your cerebrum. 2. The cerebellum is the next largest part of the brain. It controls body position, coordination, and balance. Hakeems cerebellum kicked in when he started to lose his balance on the railing in the opening photo. It allowed him to regain his balance. 3. The brain stem (also called the medulla) is the smallest part of the brain. It controls involuntary body functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. It also carries nerve impulses back and forth between the rest of the brain and the spinal cord. </p>

        <h3>Hemispheres and Lobes of the Cerebrum</h3>
        <p>The cerebrum is divided down the middle from the front to the back of the head. The two halves of the cerebrum are called the right and left hemispheres. The two hemispheres are very similar but not identical. They are connected to each other by a thick bundle of axons deep within the brain. These axons allow the two hemispheres to communicate with each other. Did you know that the right hemisphere of the cerebrum controls the left side of the body, and vice versa? This can happen because of the connections between the two hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further divided into four parts, called lobes, as you can see in Figure 20.6. Each lobe has different functions. One function of each lobe is listed in the figure. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>The Spinal Cord</h3>
        <p>The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons. It runs from the brain stem to the lower back. The main job of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. The spinal cord is like a two-way road. Messages about the body, both inside and out, pass through the spinal cord to the brain. Messages from the brain pass in the other direction through the spinal cord to tell the body what to do. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Peripheral Nervous System</h3>
        <p>All the other nervous tissues in the body are part of the peripheral nervous system. If you look again at Figure 20.1, you can see the major nerves of the peripheral nervous system. They include nerves that run through virtually every part of the body, both inside and out, except for the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system has two main divisions: the sensory division and the motor division. The divisions carry messages in opposite directions. Figure 20.7 shows these divisions of the peripheral nervous system. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Sensory Division</h3>
        <p>The sensory division of the peripheral nervous system carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. For example, it carries messages about images from the eyes to the brain. Once the messages reach the brain, the brain interprets the information. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Motor Division</h3>
        <p>The motor division of the peripheral nervous system carries messages from the central nervous system to muscles, internal organs, and glands throughout the body. The brain sends commands to these tissues, telling them how to respond. As you can see in Figure 20.7, the motor division is divided into additional parts. The autonomic part of the motor division controls involuntary responses. It sends messages to organs and glands. These messages control the body both during emergencies (sympathetic division) and during none- mergencies (parasympathetic division). The somatic part of the motor division controls voluntary responses. It sends messages to the skeletal muscles for movements that are under conscious control. </p>

        <h3>Nervous System Diseases and Injuries</h3>
        <p>Nervous system problems include diseases and injuries. Most nervous system diseases cant be prevented. But you can take steps to decrease your risk of nervous system injuries. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Infections of the Nervous System</h3>
        <p>Bacteria and viruses can infect the brain or spinal cord. An infection of the brain is called encephalitis. An infection of the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord is called meningitis. A vaccine is available to prevent meningitis caused by viruses (see Figure 20.8). Encephalitis and meningitis arent very common, but they can be extremely serious. They may cause swelling of the brain, which can be fatal. Thats why its important to know the symptoms of these diseases. Both encephalitis and meningitis typically cause a severe headache and a fever. Meningitis also causes a stiff neck. Both require emergency medical treatment. </p>

        <h3>Epilepsy</h3>
        <p>Epilepsy is a disease in which seizures occur. A seizure is a period of lost consciousness that may include violent muscle contractions. It is caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Epilepsy may result from an infection, injury, or tumor. In many cases, however, the cause cant be identified. There is no known cure for epilepsy, but the seizures often can be prevented with medicine. Sometimes children with epilepsy outgrow it by adulthood. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Stroke</h3>
        <p>A stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain. Brain cells die quickly when their oxygen supply is cut off. Therefore, a stroke may cause permanent loss of normal mental functions. Many stroke patients suffer some degree of paralysis, or loss of the ability to feel or move certain parts of the body. If medical treatment is given very soon after a stroke occurs, some of the damage may be reversed. Strokes occur mainly in older adults. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Alzheimers Disease</h3>
        <p>Alzheimers disease is another disease that occurs mainly in older adults. In Alzheimers disease, a person gradually loses most normal mental functions. The patient typically suffers from increasing memory loss, confusion, and mood swings. The cause of Alzheimers isnt known for certain, but it appears to be associated with certain abnormal changes in the brain. There is no known cure for this devastating disease, but medicines may be able to slow its progression. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Injuries to the Brain and Spinal Cord</h3>
        <p>The brain and spinal cord are protected within bones of the skeletal system, but injuries to these organs still occur. With mild injuries, there may be no lasting effects. With severe injuries, there may be permanent disability or even death. Brain and spinal cord injuries most commonly occur because of car crashes or athletic activities. Fortunately, many injuries can be prevented by wearing seat belts and safety helmets (see Figure 20.9). Avoiding unnecessary risks, such as doing stunts on a bike or diving into shallow water, can also reduce the chances of brain and spinal cord injuries. The most common type of brain injury is a concussion. This is a bruise on the surface of the brain. It may cause temporary symptoms such as headache and confusion. Most concussions heal on their own in a few days or weeks. However, repeated concussions can lead to permanent changes in the brain. More serious brain injuries also often cause permanent brain damage. Spinal cord injuries may cause paralysis. Some people recover from spinal cord injuries. However, many people remain paralyzed for life. This happens when the spinal cord can no longer transmit nerve impulses between the body and brain. </p>

        <h3>Drugs and the Nervous System</h3>
        <p>A drug is any chemical substance that affects the body or brain. Some drugs are medicines. Although these drugs are helpful when used properly, they can be misused like any other drug. Drugs that arent medicines include both legal and illegal drugs. Both can do harm. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Psychoactive Drugs</h3>
        <p>Many drugs affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. Such drugs are called psychoactive drugs. They include legal drugs such as caffeine and alcohol, as well as illegal drugs such as cocaine and heroin. They also include certain medicines, such as antidepressant drugs and medical marijuana. Some psychoactive drugs, such as caffeine, stimulate the central nervous system. They may make the user feel more alert. Some psychoactive drugs, such as alcohol, depress the central nervous system. They may make the user feel more relaxed. Still other psychoactive drugs, such as marijuana, are hallucinogenic drugs. They may make the user have altered sensations, perceptions, or thoughts. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Drug Abuse and Drug Addiction</h3>
        <p>Psychoactive drugs may bring about changes in mood that users find desirable. These drugs may be abused. Drug abuse is use of a drug without the advice of a medical professional and for reasons not originally intended. Continued use of a psychoactive drug may lead to drug addiction. This occurs when a drug user is unable to stop using the drug. Over time, a drug user may need more of the drug to get the desired effect. This can lead to drug overdose and death. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The nervous system is a complex network of nervous tissue that carries electrical messages throughout the body. Its functions include controlling muscles, maintaining balance, sensing internal and external environ- ments, controlling body systems to maintain homeostasis, preparing the body for emergencies, and allowing higher mental functions such as thinking. The nervous system is made up of bundles of nerve cells called neurons. Messages carried by neurons are called nerve impulses. A nerve impulse can travel very quickly because it is an electrical signal. Neurotrans- mitters carry nerve impulses between neurons at synapses. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain serves as the control center of the nervous system and the body as a whole. It consists of three major parts: the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem. The spinal cord carries nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain. All other nervous tissue in the body makes up the peripheral nervous system, which has two major divisions. The sensory division carries messages from sense organs and internal organs to the central nervous system. The motor division carries messages from the central nervous system to muscles, internal organs, and glands throughout the body. The motor division is further divided into parts that control involuntary or voluntary responses. Diseases of the nervous system include infections, epilepsy, strokes, and Alzheimers disease. Injuries in- clude concussions and spinal cord damage that may cause paralysis. Most nervous system diseases cant be prevented, but many nervous system injuries can be prevented by following safe practices. Psychoactive drugs affect the brain and influence how a person feels, thinks, or acts. They include medicines and other legal drugs as well as illegal drugs. They may stimulate or depress the central nervous system. Abuse of such drugs may lead to drug addiction, overdose, and death. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the various parts of the human brain. The three main parts of the brain are the cerebrum, cerebellum and medula. The cerebrum is divided down the middle from the front to the back of the head. The two halves of the cerebrum are called the right and left hemispheres. Each hemisphere is further subdivided into lobes which are shown in this diagram. The lobes shown are frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and occipital lobe. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, the next largest part is the cerebellum. The spinal cord is a long, tube-shaped bundle of neurons. Cererbum controls conscious functions, such as thinking, sensing, speaking, and voluntary muscle movements. Cerebellum controls body position, coordination, and balance. The main function of the spinal cord is to carry nerve impulses back and forth between the body and brain.</p>

        <p>This is a diagram of the anatomy of a brain. The brain is made up of several parts, as you can see in the picture. The brain has four lobes. The frontal lobe is used for the basic purpose of reasoning. The parietal lobe is used for the sense, touch. The temporal lobe is used for hearing. The occipital lobe is used for sight. The cerebellum is the next largest part of the brain. It controls body position, coordination, and balance.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the human nervous system. The nervous system conducts stimuli from sensory receptors to the brain and spinal cord and that conducts impulses back to other parts of the body. As with other higher vertebrates, the human nervous system has two main parts: the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (the nerves that carry impulses to and from the central nervous system). The nervous system consists of the brain, spinal cord, sensory organs, and all the nerves that connect these organs with the rest of the body. Together, these organs are responsible for the control of the body and communication among its parts. The brain and spinal cord from the control center known as the central nervous system.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the anatomy of a multipolar neutron. A multipolar neuron (or multipolar neurone) is a type of neuron that possesses a single (usually long) axon and many dendrites, allowing for the integration of a great deal of information from other neurons. These dendritic branches can also emerge from the nerve cell body. Multipolar neurons constitute the majority of neurons in the brain and include motor neurons and interneurons. It is found majority in the cerebral cortex. The nerve endings of an axon don't actually touch the dendrites of other neurons. The messages must cross a tiny gap between the two neurons, called the synapse. There are two types of synaptic cells: presynaptic and postsynaptic. The presynaptic cell is the neuron sending the signal. The postsynaptic cell is the structure receiving the signal.</p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the parts of a neuron. A neuron is a basic building block of the nervous system that is responsible for receiving and transmitting information. Dendrites are treelike extensions at the beginning of a neuron that help increase the surface area of the cell body. The cell body is where the signals from the dendrites are joined and passed on. The nucleus is present within the cell body. It produces RNA that supports important cell functions. The axon is the elongated fiber that connects the cell body to the axon endings and transmits the neural signal. The axon is often covered with a fatty substance called the myelin sheath that acts as an insulator.</p>
