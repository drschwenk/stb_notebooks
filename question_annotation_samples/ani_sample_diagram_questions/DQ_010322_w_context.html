        <h3>Protist Classification and Evolution</h3>
        <p>Protists are placed in the Protist Kingdom. This kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya domain. The other three Eukarya kingdoms are the Fungi, Plant, and Animal Kingdoms. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Classification of Protists</h3>
        <p>The Protist Kingdom is hard to define. It includes many different types of organisms. You can see some examples of protists in Figure 9.1. The Protist Kingdom includes all eukaryotes that dont fit into one of the other three eukaryote kingdoms. For that reason, its sometimes called the trash can kingdom. The number of species in the Protist Kingdom is unknown. It could range from as few as 60,000 to as many as 200,000 species.

        <h3>Evolution of Protists</h3>
        <p>Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotes. How did this happen? How did cells without organelles acquire them? What was the origin of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles? The most likely way organelles evolved is shown in Figure 9.2. First, smaller prokaryotic cells invaded, or were engulfed by, larger prokaryotic cells. The smaller cells benefited by getting nutrients and a safe place to live. The larger cells benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the smaller cells. Eventually, the smaller cells evolved into organelles in the larger cells. After that, neither could live without the other. </p>

        <h3>General Traits of Protists</h3>
        <p>Despite the diversity of protists, they do share some traits. The cells of all protists have a nucleus. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. For example, all of them have mitochondria, and some of them have chloroplasts. Most protists consist of a single cell. Some are multicellular but they lack specialized cells. Most protists live in wet places. They are found in oceans, lakes, swamps, or damp soils. Many protists can move. Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation. This helps ensure that some organisms will survive if conditions change. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Protists</h3>
        <p>Protists are classified based on traits they share with other eukaryotes. There are animal-like, plant-like, and fungus- like protists. The three groups differ mainly in how they get carbon and energy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>AnimalLike Protists</h3>
        <p>Animal-like protists are called protozoa (protozoan, singular). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. Protozoa are probably ancestors of animals. Protozoa are like animals in two ways: 1. Protozoa are heterotrophs. Heterotrophs get food by eating other organisms. Some protozoa prey on bacteria. Some are parasites of animals. Others graze on algae. Still others are decomposers that break down dead organic matter. 2. Almost all protozoa can move. They have special appendages for this purpose. You can see different types in Figure 9.3. Cilia (cilium, singular) are short, hair-like projections. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of the cytoplasm. Flagella are long, whip-like structures. Flagella are also found in most prokaryotes. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>PlantLike Protists</h3>
        <p>Plant-like protists are commonly called algae (alga, singular). Some algae consist of single cells. They are called diatoms. Other algae are multicellular. An example is seaweed. Seaweed called kelp can grow as large as trees. You can see both a diatom and kelp in Figure 9.4. Algae are probably ancestors of plants. Algae are like plants mainly because they contain chloroplasts. This allows them to make food by photosynthesis. Algae are important producers in water-based ecosystems such as the ocean. On the other hand, algae lack other plant structures. For example, they dont have roots, stems, or leaves. Also unlike plants, some algae can move. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. </p>

        <h3>FungusLike Protists</h3>
        <p>Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5. They exist as individual cells or as many cells that form a blob-like colony. They are probably ancestors of fungi. Like fungi, many fungus-like protists are decomposers. They absorb nutrients from dead logs, compost, and other organic remains Slime molds are commonly found on rotting organic matter such as compost. Swarms of cells move very slowly over the surface. They digest and absorb nutrients as they go. Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many water molds are plant pathogens or fish parasites. </p>

        <h3>Protists and Human Diseases</h3>
        <p>Many human diseases are caused by protists. Most of them are caused by protozoa. They are parasites that invade and live in the human body. The parasites get a place to live and nutrients from the human host. In return, they make the host sick. Examples of human diseases caused by protozoa include giardiasis and malaria. Protozoa that cause giardiasis are spread by contaminated food or water. They live inside the intestine. They may cause abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. Protozoa that cause malaria are spread by a vector. They enter the blood through the bite of an infected mosquito. They live inside red blood cells. They cause overall body pain, fever, and fatigue. Malaria kills several million people each year. Most of the deaths occur in children. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Protists are eukaryotes in the Protist Kingdom. Most are single-celled organisms. Protists are thought to be the oldest eukaryotes. They probably evolved when some prokaryotic cells invaded or were engulfed by others. Traits of most protists include the ability to move, living in wet places, and complicated life cycles. Most reproduce both asexually and sexually. Protists are classified as animal-like, plant-like, or fungus-like. The three groups differ mainly in how they obtain carbon and energy. Several protozoa are human parasites. They cause diseases such as giardiasis and malaria. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the structure of a Paramecium. Paramecium is a small unicellular living organism that belongs to the kingdom of Protista. It can move, digest food, and reproduce. The pellicle, a stiff but elastic membrane, gives the Paramecium a definite shape but also allows some small changes. Covering the pellicle are many tiny hairs, called cilia. Paramecium uses its cilia to sweep prey organisms, along with some water, through the oral groove, and into the mouth opening. The food passes through the cell mouth into the gullet. Within the gullet, food particles are transformed into food vacuoles, and digestion takes place within each food vacuole; waste material is excreted through the anus. Depending on the species, a paramecium has from one to several contractile vacuoles located close to the surface near the ends of the cell. Contractile vacuoles function in regulating the water content within the cell and may also be considered excretory structures, since the expelled water contains metabolic wastes. A thin layer of ectoplasm lies directly beneath the pellicle and encloses the endoplasm. The endoplasm contains granules, food vacuoles, and crystals of different sizes. Embedded in the ectoplasm are spindle-shaped bodies (trichocysts) that may be released by chemical, electrical, or mechanical means. Paramecium has two kinds of nuclei: a large ellipsoidal nucleus called a macronucleus that controls vegetative functions and at least one small nucleus called a micronucleus. The organism cannot survive without the macronucleus and it cannot reproduce without the micronucleus.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows some parts an organism called an Amoeba. The term amoeba refers to simple organisms that move in a characteristic crawling fashion. Amoebas are single celled organism that has a nucleus and appears transparent and gelatin like due to its clear ectoplasm and cell membrane. It is also the part of the cell that allows it to form its pseudopodia and preform its respective functions. Amoeba can change shape and move around by extending their pseudopodia (shown as pseudopodium), or 'false feet. A food vacuole is basically a storage unit of food for the amoeba and is formed only when the amoeba has engulfed its prey completely and then digestive enzymes are released into the vacuole. The contractile vacuole is basically a water bubble within the endoplasm. Its function is to regulate the water content of the cell. It is also a means of excreting its waste from the cell.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the parts of an Euglena cell. Euglena is an eukaryotic unicellular organism, it contains the major organelles found in more complex life. Below are the organelles of an euglena. Its flagellum is a long, mobile filament that the Euglena uses to propel itself in its environment. The reservoir is the part used for storage of nutrients. The stigma is the light sensitive-spot that allows the Euglena to detect light, so that it may move towards it in order to conduct photosynthesis. The chloroplast is the organelle that allows the organism to conduct photosynthesis. The contractile Vacuole which Expels excess water into the reservoir, or else the cell would burst. The pellicle is the stiff membrane made of proteins and somewhat flexible, can also be used for locomotion when crunching up and down or wriggling. It has the nucleus which is the central organelle which contains DNA and controls the cell's activity, contained within the Nucleolus</p>
