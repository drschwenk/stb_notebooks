        <h3>Introduction to Changes of State</h3>
        <p>What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>What Are Changes of State</h3>
        <p>Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. Common changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and vaporization. These changes are shown in Figure 4.18. Each is described in detail below. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Energy Temperature and Changes of State</h3>
        <p>Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer. Thats because a thermometer measures temperature, and temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. You can learn more about energy, temperature, and changes of state at this URL: http://hogan.chem.lsu.edu/matter/chap26/animate3/an2 </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Changes Between Liquids and Solids</h3>
        <p>Think about how you would make ice cubes in a tray. First you would fill the tray with water from a tap. Then you would place the tray in the freezer compartment of a refrigerator. The freezer is very cold. What happens next? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Freezing</h3>
        <p>The warmer water in the tray loses heat to the colder air in the freezer. The water cools until its particles no longer have enough energy to slide past each other. Instead, they remain in fixed positions, locked in place by the forces of attraction between them. The liquid water has changed to solid ice. Another example of liquid water changing to solid ice is pictured in Figure 4.19. The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is its freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0C (32F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower freezing points. For example, the freezing point of iron is 1535C. The freezing point of oxygen is -219C. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 4.19 Water dripping from a gutter turned to ice as it fell toward the ground, forming icicles. Why did the liquid water change to a solid?</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Melting</h3>
        <p>If you took ice cubes out of a freezer and left them in a warm room, the ice would absorb energy from the warmer air around it. The energy would allow the particles of frozen water to overcome some of the forces of attraction holding them together. They would be able to slip out of the fixed positions they held as ice. In this way, the solid ice would turn to liquid water. The process in which a solid changes to a liquid is called melting. The melting point is the temperature at which a solid changes to a liquid. For a given type of matter, the melting point is the same as the freezing point. What is the melting point of ice? What is the melting point of iron, pictured in Figure 4.20? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Changes Between Liquids and Gases</h3>
        <p>If you fill a pot with cool tap water and place the pot on a hot stovetop, the water heats up. Heat energy travels from the stovetop to the pot, and the water absorbs the energy from the pot. What happens to the water next? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Vaporization</h3>
        <p>If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 4.20 Molten (melted) iron is poured into a mold at a foundry. It takes extremely high temperatures to change iron from a solid to the liquid shown here. Thats because iron has a very high melting point.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Evaporation</h3>
        <p>A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling. This process is called evaporation. It occurs when particles at the exposed surface of a liquid absorb just enough energy to pull away from the liquid and escape into the air. This happens faster at warmer temperatures. Look at the puddle in Figure 4.21. It formed in a pothole during a rain shower. The puddle will eventually evaporate. It will evaporate faster if the sun comes out and heats the water than if the sky remains cloudy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Condensation</h3>
        <p>If you take a hot shower in a closed bathroom, the mirror is likely to "fog" up. The "fog" consists of tiny droplets of water that form on the cool surface of the mirror. Why does this happen? Some of the hot water from the shower evaporates, so the air in the bathroom contains a lot of water vapor. When the water vapor contacts cooler surfaces, such as the mirror, it cools and loses energy. The cooler water particles no longer have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them. They come together and form droplets of liquid water. The process in which a gas changes to a liquid is called condensation. Other examples of condensation are shown in Figure 4.22. A gas condenses when it is cooled below its boiling point. At what temperature does water vapor condense? </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Changes Between Solids and Gases</h3>
        <p>Solids that change to gases generally first pass through the liquid state. However, sometimes solids change directly to gases and skip the liquid state. The reverse can also occur. Sometimes gases change directly to solids. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Sublimation</h3>
        <p>The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation. It occurs when the particles of a solid absorb enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them. Dry ice (solid carbon dioxide, CO2 ) is an example of a solid that undergoes sublimation. Figure 4.23 shows a chunk of dry ice changing directly to carbon dioxide gas. Sometimes snow undergoes sublimation as well. This is most likely to occur on sunny winter days when the air is very dry. What gas does snow become? </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Deposition</h3>
        <p>The opposite of sublimation is deposition. This is the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state. It occurs when gas particles become very cold. For example, when water vapor in the air contacts a very cold windowpane, the water vapor may change to tiny ice crystals on the glass. The ice crystals are called frost. You can see an example in Figure 4.24. </p>

        <p>There are 4 states of matter observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas and plasma. This diagram shows 3 of these states: solid, liquid and gas and the processes that cause matter to change states. When a gas changes to a liquid, a liquid changes to a solid or a gas changes to a solid, heat is given out. Conversely, when a solid changes to a liquid, a liquid changes to a gas and a solid changes to a gas, heat is taken in. The names of these processes are provided in the diagram. For example: the process of state change from gas to liquid is called condensation. The process of change from liquid to solid is called freezing. The process of change from solid to liquid is called melting and the process of change from solid to gas is called sublimation.</p>

        <p>The image below shows the different changes in states of matter. A material will change from one state or phase to another at specific combinations of temperature and surrounding pressure. Typically, the pressure is atmospheric pressure, so temperature is the determining factor to the change in state in those cases. The names of the changes in state are melting, freezing, boiling, condensation, sublimation and deposition. The temperature of a material will increase until it reaches the point where the change takes place. It will stay at that temperature until that change is completed. Solids are one of the three phase changes. Their structure and their resistance to change their shape or volume characterize solids. In a solid, the molecules are closely packed together. Liquids are the next of the three phase changes. Liquids are very different from solids, their structure is a bit freer, but not as free as gas. In a liquid phase, the molecules will take the shape of its container or the object that it is in. Gases are the last of the three phase changes. A gas phase is one of the simpler phases, because the gas molecules are the freest. This is because theoretically the molecules behave completely chaotically and they roam anywhere and fill every space of an object or container.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the changes of state of matter. The state shifts based from the amount of energy added or removed by the matter. If energy is added to the matter, the particles will slowly disperse away from each other until they are separated from each other. Some examples of this change of state is melting (converting solid to liquid) and evaporation (converting liquid to gas). On the other hand, if the energy is removed, the particles will gather themselves together until they are close to each other. Condensation (converting gas to liquid) and freezing (converting liquid to solid) are some process involving this change.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the changes of state in matter. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. They occur when matter absorbs or loses energy. Processes in which matter changes between liquid and solid states are freezing and melting. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. Freezing happens when the water cools and loses energy until they remain in fixed positions as ice. Processes in which matter changes between liquid and gaseous states are vaporization, evaporation, and condensation. Processes in which matter changes between solid and gaseous states are sublimation and deposition.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows how matter changes state. A material will change from one state or phase to another at specific combinations of temperature and surrounding pressure. Typically, the pressure is atmospheric pressure, so temperature is the determining factor to the change in state in those cases. The states of matter shown are ice (solid), water (liquid) and water vapor (gas). When heat is applied to a material, its change in state typically goes from solid to liquid to gas. There are some exceptions where the material will go directly from a solid to a gas. When a material is cooled, its change in state typically goes from gas to liquid to solid. There are some exceptions where the material will go directly from a gas to a solid.</p>
