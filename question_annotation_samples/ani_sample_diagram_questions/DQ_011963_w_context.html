        <h3>Chemical Bonding</h3>
        <p>Elements form compounds when they combine chemically. Their atoms join together to form molecules, crystals, or other structures. The atoms are held together by chemical bonds. A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms or ions. It occurs when atoms share or transfer valence electrons. Valence electrons are the electrons in the outer energy level of an atom. You can learn more about chemical bonds in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Look at the example of water in Figure 7.1. A water molecule consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Each hydrogen atom has just one electron. The oxygen atom has six valence electrons. In a water molecule, two hydrogen atoms share their two electrons with the six valence electrons of one oxygen atom. By sharing electrons, each atom has electrons available to fill its sole or outer energy level. This gives it a more stable arrangement of electrons that takes less energy to maintain. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 7.1 These diagrams show the valence elec- trons of hydrogen and water atoms and a water molecule. The diagrams represent electrons with dots, so they are called electron dot diagrams.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Chemical Compounds</h3>
        <p>Water (H2 O) is an example of a chemical compound. Water molecules always consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Like water, all other chemical compounds consist of a fixed ratio of elements. It doesnt matter how much or how little of a compound there is. It always has the same composition. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Chemical Formulas</h3>
        <p>Elements are represented by chemical symbols. Examples are H for hydrogen and O for oxygen. Compounds are represented by chemical formulas. Youve already seen the chemical formula for water. Its H2 O. The subscript 2 after the H shows that there are two atoms of hydrogen in a molecule of water. The O for oxygen has no subscript. When there is just one atom of an element in a molecule, no subscript is used. Table 7.1 shows some other examples of compounds and their chemical formulas. Name of Compound Electron Dot Diagram Numbers of Atoms Chemical Formula Name of Compound Hydrogen chloride Electron Dot Diagram Numbers of Atoms H=1 Cl = 1 Chemical Formula HCl Methane C=1 H=4 CH4 Hydrogen peroxide H=2 O=2 H2 O2 Carbon dioxide C=1 O=2 CO2 Problem Solving Problem: A molecule of ammonia consists of one atom of nitrogen (N) and three atoms of hydrogen (H). What is its chemical formula? Solution: The chemical formula is NH3 . You Try It! Problem: A molecule of nitrogen dioxide consists of one atom of nitrogen (N) and two atoms of oxygen (O). What is its chemical formula? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Same Elements Different Compounds</h3>
        <p>The same elements may combine in different ratios. If they do, they form different compounds. Figure 7.2 shows some examples. Both water (H2 O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) consist of hydrogen and oxygen. However, they have different ratios of the two elements. As a result, water and hydrogen peroxide are different compounds with different properties. If youve ever used hydrogen peroxide to disinfect a cut, then you know that it is very different from water! Both carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO) consist of carbon and oxygen, but in different ratios. How do their properties differ? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Compounds</h3>
        <p>There are different types of compounds. They differ in the nature of the bonds that hold their atoms together. The type of bonds in a compound determines many of its properties. Three types of bonds are ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds. You will read about these three types in later lessons. You can also learn more about them by watching this video:  (7:18).

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A chemical bond is a force of attraction between atoms. It occurs when atoms share or transfer electrons. A chemical compound is a new substance that forms when atoms of different elements form chemical bonds. A compound always consists of a fixed ratio of elements. </p>

        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>4. Why does a molecule of water have a more stable arrangement of electrons than do individual hydrogen and oxygen atoms? 5. Explain how the ratio of elements in a compound is related to the compounds properties. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, you learned about chemical bonds in a water molecule. The bonds form between atoms of hydrogen and oxygen when they share electrons. This type of bond is an example of a covalent bond. What might be other ways that atoms can bond together? How might ions form bonds? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>There is an amazing diversity of matter in the universe, but there are only about 100 elements. How can this relatively small number of pure substances make up all kinds of matter? Elements can combine in many different ways. When they do, they form new substances called compounds.

        <p>This image shows the chemical structure of Acetylene. Acetylene is the chemical compound with the formula C2H2. It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne. As an alkyne, acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in a triple bond. The carboncarbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line, with CCH bond angles of 180.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the Lewis Dot Structure of Carbon. Lewis Structures are visual representations of the bonds between atoms and illustrate the lone pairs of electrons in molecules. The electrons in the outermost electron shell are called valence electrons. These electrons have an essential role in chemical bonding. Lewis Structures can also be called Lewis dot diagrams and are used as a simple way to show the configuration of atoms within a molecule. In constructing a Lewis Structure, an element is represented by a Lewis symbol (e.g. C for Carbon). It is surrounded by dots that are used to represent the valence electrons of the element. Lewis symbols differ slightly for ions. When forming a Lewis symbol for an ion, the chemical symbol is surrounded by dots that are used to represent valence electrons, and the whole structure is placed in square brackets with superscript representing the charge of the ion.</p>

        <p>Water is a transparent common substance that makes up the earth's oceans, lakes, seas, rivers, streams and more. Water is essential for every living thing to replenish and hydrate. The chemical formula for water contains one oxygen atom to two hydrogen atoms. Everything from the earth's crust to the human brain contain great amounts of water. Water on earth is continually being used and then goes through the water cycle to become new and usable again. The water cycle involves evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and runoff. Even though water does not have any calories or nutritional benefit it is essential to all living forms on earth. Fishing which occurs in salt and fresh type waters yields much food for the world's people. Water even involves exercise for those who like to swim and engage in other sports like water skiing, wakeboarding and so on.</p>
