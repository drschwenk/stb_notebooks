        <h3>How Do We Know About Earths Interior</h3>
        <p>If someone told you to figure out what is inside Earth, what would you do? How could you figure out what is inside our planet? How do scientists figure it out? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Seismic Waves</h3>
        <p>Geologists study earthquake waves to see Earths interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquakes focus. These are called seismic waves (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves change speed as they move through different materials. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. Scientists use all of this information to understand what makes up the Earths interior. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Meteorites</h3>
        <p>Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earths interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent early solar system materials. Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel. They are thought to be very similar to Earths core (Figure 6.2). An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands! </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <p>Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. Its understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers (Figure 6.3). Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Oceanic Crust</h3>
        <p>There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Continental Crust</h3>
        <p>Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks. All three major rock types  igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary  are found in the crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm3) than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mantle</h3>
        <p>Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects (Figure 6.4). The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards (Figure 6.5). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>Core</h3>
        <p>The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal from studying metallic meteorites and the Earths density. Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid, while the inner core is solid. Movement within Earths outer liquid iron core creates Earths magnetic field. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lithosphere and Asthenosphere</h3>
        <p>Lithosphere and asthenosphere are layers based on physical properties. The outermost layer is the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the crust and the uppermost mantle. In terms of physical properties, this layer is rigid, solid, and brittle. It is easily cracked or broken. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle. This layer is solid, but it can flow and bend. A solid that can flow is like silly putty. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Describe the properties of the lithosphere and asthenosphere. What parts of the Earth do these layers include? 5. When you put your hand near a pan above a pan filled with boiling water, does your hand warm up because of convection or conduction? If you touch the pan, does your hand warm up because of convection or conduction? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Compare and describe each of Earths layers.
Compare some of the ways geologists learn about Earths interior.
Define oceanic and continental crust and the lithosphere.
Describe how heat moves, particularly how convection takes place in the mantle.
Compare the two parts of the core and describe why they are different from each other.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The Earth is made of three layers with different composition: the crust, mantle, and core. The lithosphere is made of the rigid, brittle, solid crust and uppermost mantle. Beneath the lithosphere, the asthenosphere is solid rock that can flow. The hot core warms the base of the mantle, which creates convection currents in the mantle. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>6. List two reasons that scientists know that the outer core is liquid. 7. Suppose that Earths interior contains a large amount of lead. Lead is very dense: 11.34 g/cm3 . Would the lead be more likely to be found in the crust, mantle, or core? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The oceanic crust is thinner and denser than continental crust. All crust sits atop the mantle. What might our planet be like if this were not true. If sediments fall onto the seafloor over time, what can sediment thickness tell scientists about the age of the seafloor in different regions? How might convection cells in the mantle affect the movement of plates of lithosphere on the planets surface? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>From outside to inside, Earth is divided into crust, mantle, and core. Each has a different chemical makeup. Earth can also be divided into layers with different properties. The two most important are lithosphere and asthenosphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. List two ways that scientists learn about what makes up the Earths interior. 2. What type of rock makes up the oceanic crust? 3. What types of rock make up the continental crust? </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the different layers of the earth. The earth is composed of mainly 3 layers: crust, mantle and the core. The crust is the outer layer of the earth. It is a thin layer between 0-33 km thick. The crust is the solid rock layer upon which we live. The mantle is the widest section of the earth. The mantle is made up of semi-molten rocks called magma. Mantle can be further divided into upper mantle and lower mantle. Upper mantle lies between 33-670 km below the earth's crust and the rock is typically hard in this layer. Lower mantle lies between 670-2900 km below the earth's crust and consists of semi-molten rocks. Core is the innermost layer of the earth. It is further divided into upper core and inner core. Inner core is the center and the hottest part of the earth. It is solid and made up of iron and nickel with temperatures of up to 5500C. It lies between 5150-6370km below earth's crust. Outer core is the layer surrounding the inner core. It is a liquid layer made up of iron and nickel with temperatures similar to inner core. It lies between 2900-5150 km below the earth's crust.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the different layers of the Earth, from the inner core to the atmosphere. The three main layers of the Earth are the crust, the mantle, and the core. The crust is the thin, brittle outer shell that covers the Earth. There are two types of crusts: oceanic and continental. Oceanic crust is what we call the ocean floor. It is composed mostly of dense volcanic rock and mud that flowed to the bottom of the ocean. Continental crust makes up what we call the land masses or continents. It is formed three different types of rocks: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Under the crust is the Earths mantle, which is made of hot, solid rock. The mantle is also divided into two kinds: lower and upper. The lower mantle gets its heat directly from the Earths core. Finally, the innermost layer of the Earth is called the core, which is made up of dense, iron core. The outer core is liquid, whereas the inner core is solid. The liquid outer core creates the Earths magnetic fields. The inner core is the innermost layer and comprises the center of the Earth.</p>

There is an upper mantle and a lower mantle and they are formed of hot, solid rock. The outer core lies beneath the lower mantle and this is a fluid layer. The inner core is a solid ball and is the hottest of the layers. This is the Earth's innermost part. The distance from the crust to the center of the Earth is 6371 kilometers.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the various parts or layers of the earth. The outermost layer is the Crust. The crust is the thinnest layer of the earth. Below the crust lies the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Below the mantle lies the outer core. The outer core of the Earth is a fluid layer. The inner core is the Earth's innermost part. It is a solid ball with a radius of about 1220 kilometers. The inner core is the hottest of the layers. The temperature at the inner core boundary is approximately 5700 K.</p>

        <p>The diagram illustrates the cross section of the Earth's crust and what causes Earthquakes. A Fault is a fracture in the Earths crust separating two blocks of the Earth's crust that slide against one another during an earthquake. The Epicenter is the point on the Earths surface located directly over the Focus, where the most violent tremors are felt. The Focus is also a point in the Earths crust where an earthquake is triggered. Also called the Hypocenter. Shown also are the Wave fronts or seismic waves which is a series of vibrations generated at the focus that disperse in all directions, causing shaking of the Earths surface. A fault scarp is a small step or offset on the ground surface where one side of a fault has moved vertically with respect to the other. They are characterized by uneven landscapes. Fault scarps may be only a few centimeters or many meters high.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the nature of earthquakes. An earthquake is sudden ground movement. This movement is caused by the sudden release of the energy stored in rocks. An earthquake happens when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks break and energy is transmitted by seismic waves. As depicted in the diagram, Focus is the point where the rock ruptures are the earthquakes focus. The area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquakes epicenter.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This diagram shows how body waves from and earthquake travel through the Earth. There are two types of body waves: P-waves and S-waves. Both types originate at the earthquake's epicenter. P-waves, or primary waves, travel faster than S-waves and are first to reach a seismometer. They can travel through solids, liquids, and gases, meaning they are able to penetrate the Earth's mantle, liquid outer core, and solid inner core. S-waves, or secondary waves, are about half as fast as P-waves and can only travel through solids. Therefore, they cannot penetrate the Earth's liquid outer core and only travel through the mantle. This creates a large section of the Earth at about 140 degrees away from the epicenter where there are no direct S-waves.</p>
