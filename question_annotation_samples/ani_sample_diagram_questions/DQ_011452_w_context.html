        <h3>Solenoids</h3>
        <p>A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it a magnetic field (see Figure 25.5). Recall that current flowing through a straight wire produces a weak electromagnetic field that circles around the wire. Current flowing through a coil of wire, in contrast, produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles like a bar magnet. The magnetic field around a coiled wire is also stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire because each turn of the wire has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns increases the strength of the field, as does increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil.

        <h3>Electromagnets</h3>
        <p>Solenoids are the basis of electromagnets. An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material (see Figure 25.6). The electromagnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. The combined magnetic force of the magnetized iron bar and the wire coil makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. Some of them are strong enough to lift a train. The maglev train described earlier, in the lesson "Electricity and Magnetism," contains permanent magnets. Strong electromagnets in the track repel the train magnets, causing the train to levitate above the track. Like a solenoid, an electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil or more current is flowing through it. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnets strength. You can see how to make a simple electromagnet at this URL:  (4:57).

        <h3>Electromagnetic Devices</h3>
        <p>Many common electric devices contain electromagnets. Some examples include hair dryers, fans, CD players, telephones, and doorbells. Most electric devices that have moving parts contain electric motors. You can read below how doorbells and electric motors use electromagnets. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How a Doorbell Works</h3>
        <p>Figure 25.7 shows a diagram of a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a voltage source, an electromagnet, and the clapper of a bell. When current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off. The clapper returns to its original position, which closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. This sequence of events keeps repeating as long as the button by the front door is being pressed. </p>

        <h3>Electric Motors</h3>
        <p>An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. Figure 25.8 shows a simple diagram of an electric motor. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet turns, causing the shaft to turn as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. Why does the motors electromagnet turn? Notice that the electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to turn toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are once again repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to continue to turn. These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously. You can make a very simple electric motor with a battery, wire, and magnet following instructions at this URL:  . </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. It produces a strong magnetic field with north and south poles like a bar magnet. An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. The magnetic field of the coil magnetizes the bar, which adds to the strength of the magnetic field. Electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. Many common electric devices, such as doorbells, contain electromagnets. If they have moving parts, they are likely to have an electric motor. An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, you saw how electric current can be used to create a strong electromagnetic field. In the next lesson, "Generating and Using Electricity," youll find out how a magnetic field can be used to generate an electric current. Can you predict how this might be done? A device that uses a magnetic field to generate electricity is called a generator. What do you already know about generators from previous chapters? (Hint: Look at the figure on how energy constantly changes form in the "Introduction to Energy" chapter.) </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Do you believe in ghosts? The man in the Figure 25.4 does. Hes hoping to record sights or sounds of ghost on his video camera. The other device hes holding is an electromagnetic field detector. Ghost hunters often use detectors like this one because they believe that ghosts cause changes in electromagnetic fields. The problem for ghost hunters is that electromagnetic fields can be produced by many devices. You can read about some of them in this lesson. They may not be as exciting as ghosts, but they are a lot more useful! </p>

        <p>In this diagram, a coil of insulated wire is wound around an iron nail. The wire from the nail is connected directly to the positive terminal of a battery at one end, and through a switch to its negative terminal at the other. When the switch is thrown, the wire forms a complete circuit and an electric current flows from the negative terminal through the wire to the positive terminal. The current flowing through the wire produces a magnetic field resembling the field of a bar magnet with the poles alligned with the nail the wire is wrapped around. The iron the nail is made from is ferromagnetic, and the magnetic field generated by the current in the wire causes the magnetic domains in the iron to allign with it. This makes for a stronger magnetic field than the wire would generate on its own. This combination of a wire coiled around a ferromagnetic material is called an electromagnet.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows a simple way to make an iron nail become electromagnet. A wire is run from the positive side of a battery then coil around the nail then to the negative side of the battery. As electric current flows through the wire, magnetic field is produced around the coil of wire with the electric current. The coil of wire with electric current flowing through it is called a solenoid. The more turns the coil has, the strong the electromagnetic field will be.</p>
