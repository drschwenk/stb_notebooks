        <h3>Earths Seasons</h3>
        <p>A common misconception is that the Sun is closer to Earth in the summer and farther away from it during the winter. Instead, the seasons are caused by the 23.5o tilt of Earths axis of rotation relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun (Figure 1.1). Solstice refers to the position of the Sun when it is closest to one of the poles. At summer solstice, June 21 or 22, Earths axis points toward the Sun and so the Sun is directly overhead at its furthest north point of the year, the Tropic of Cancer (23.5o N). During the summer, areas north of the Equator experience longer days and shorter nights. In the Southern Hemi- sphere, the Sun is as far away as it will be and so it is their winter. Locations will have longer nights and shorter days. The opposite occurs on winter solstice, which begins on December 21. More about seasons can be found in the Atmospheric Processes chapter. </p>

        <h3>Solar Radiation on Earth</h3>
        <p>Different parts of the Earth receive different amounts of solar radiation. Which part of the planet receives the most solar radiation? The Suns rays strike the surface most directly at the Equator. Different areas also receive different amounts of sunlight in different seasons. What causes the seasons? The seasons are caused by the direction Earths axis is pointing relative to the Sun. The Earth revolves around the Sun once each year and spins on its axis of rotation once each day. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.5o relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun. The axis of rotation is pointed toward Polaris, the North Star. As the Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt of Earths axis stays lined up with the North Star. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Northern Hemisphere Summer</h3>
        <p>The North Pole is tilted towards the Sun and the Suns rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in summer (Figure 1.2). At the summer solstice, June 21 or 22, the Suns rays hit the Earth most directly along the Tropic of Cancer (23.5o N); that is, the angle of incidence of the Suns rays there is zero (the angle of incidence is the deviation in the angle of an incoming ray from straight on). When it is summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Northern Hemisphere Winter</h3>
        <p>Winter solstice for the Northern Hemisphere happens on December 21 or 22. The tilt of Earths axis points away from the Sun (Figure 1.3). Light from the Sun is spread out over a larger area, so that area isnt heated as much. With fewer daylight hours in winter, there is also less time for the Sun to warm the area. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Equinox</h3>
        <p>Halfway between the two solstices, the Suns rays shine most directly at the Equator, called an equinox (Figure 1.4). The daylight and nighttime hours are exactly equal on an equinox. The autumnal equinox happens on September 22 or 23 and the vernal, or spring, equinox happens March 21 or 22 in the Northern Hemisphere. Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In the Northern Hemisphere, at summer solstice the Sun is closest to the north pole (around June 22) and at winter solstice, the Sun is closest to the south pole (around December 22). In the Southern Hemisphere, the names are changed. Over the course of a year, the amount of solar energy received by the Equator is greater than the amount received elsewhere. At equinox the Sun is directly over the Equator; autumnal equinox is around September 22 and spring equinox is around March 22 in the Northern Hemisphere. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. At summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, what is the date and where is the Sun? What is happening at the South Pole at that time? 2. Since the Sun is up for months during the summer at the north pole, why is it that the Equator actually gets the most solar radiation over the course of a year? 3. What are equinoxes and when do they come? </p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the earth's seasons. During part of the year, Earth is closer to the sun than at other times. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, we are having winter when Earth is closest to the sun and summer when it is the farthest away! Compared with how far away the sun is, this change in Earth's distance throughout the year does not make much difference to our weather's Earth orbits the sun, its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the suns direct rays.</p>

        <p>The earth revolves around the sun. Its takes one year to make one full revolution. This diagram shows different configurations of the earth and the sun over the course of one year that lead to the four prominent seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. Since the earth is inclined at an angle of 23.5 degrees, at certain times of the year, the northern hemisphere gets longer days and shorter nights, which causes the season of summer. At the same time the southern hemisphere gets shorter days and longer nights, which leads to winter. June 21 is the longest day of the year in the Northern hemisphere, and is known as the Summer Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. December 22 is the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere and is known as the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the earth's seasons. During part of the year, Earth is closer to the sun than at other times. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, we are having winter when Earth is closest to the sun and summer when it is the farthest away! Compared with how far away the sun is, this change in Earth's distance throughout the year does not make much difference to our weather. Earth's axis is an imaginary pole going right through the center of Earth from top to bottom. Earth spins around this pole, making one complete turn each day. That is why we have day and night, and why every part of Earth's surface gets some of each.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the earth's equinox phenomenon. An equinox is an astronomical event in which the plane of Earth's equator passes through the center of the Sun which occurs twice each year during spring and autumn as shown below. On an equinox, day and night are of approximately equal duration all over the planet. The equinoxes, along with solstices, are directly related to the seasons of the year. In the northern hemisphere, the vernal equinox (March) conventionally marks the beginning of spring and is considered the New Year in the Persian calendar or Iranian calendars as Nouroz (means new day). On the other hand, the autumnal equinox (September) marks the beginning of autumn. In the southern hemisphere, the vernal equinox occurs in September and the autumnal equinox in March.</p>
