        <h3>Humidity</h3>
        <p>Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air in a particular spot. We usually use the term to mean relative humidity, the percentage of water vapor a certain volume of air is holding relative to the maximum amount it can contain. If the humidity today is 80%, it means that the air contains 80% of the total amount of water it can hold at that temperature. What will happen if the humidity increases to more than 100%? The excess water condenses and forms precipitation. Since warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air, raising or lowering temperature can change airs relative humidity (Figure 1.1). The temperature at which air becomes saturated with water is called the airs dew point. This term makes sense, because water condenses from the air as dew if the air cools down overnight and reaches 100% humidity. This diagram shows the amount of water air can hold at different temperatures. The temperatures are given in degrees Cel- sius. </p>

        <h3>Clouds</h3>
        <p>Water vapor is not visible unless it condenses to become a cloud. Water vapor condenses around a nucleus, such as dust, smoke, or a salt crystal. This forms a tiny liquid droplet. Billions of these water droplets together make a cloud. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Formation</h3>
        <p>Clouds form when air reaches its dew point. This can happen in two ways: (1) Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases. This is common in locations that are warm and humid. (2) Humidity remains the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough to reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. Air cools when it comes into contact with a cold surface or when it rises. Rising air creates clouds when it has been warmed at or near the ground level and then is pushed up over a mountain or mountain range or is thrust over a mass of cold, dense air.

        <h3>Effects on Weather</h3>
        <p>Clouds have a big influence on weather: by preventing solar radiation from reaching the ground. by absorbing warmth that is re-emitted from the ground. as the source of precipitation. When there are no clouds, there is less insulation. As a result, cloudless days can be extremely hot, and cloudless nights can be very cold. For this reason, cloudy days tend to have a lower range of temperatures than clear days. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Types of Clouds</h3>
        <p>Clouds are classified in several ways. The most common classification used today divides clouds into four separate cloud groups, which are determined by their altitude (Figure 1.2). The four cloud types and where they are found in the atmosphere. High clouds form from ice crystals where the air is extremely cold and can hold little water vapor. Cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus are all names of high clouds. Middle clouds, including altocumulus and altostratus clouds, may be made of water droplets, ice crystals or both, depending on the air temperatures. Thick and broad altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray. They often cover the entire sky and usually mean a large storm, bearing a lot of precipitation, is coming. Low clouds are nearly all water droplets. Stratus, stratocumulus, and nimbostratus clouds are common low clouds. Nimbostratus clouds are thick and dark. They bring steady rain or snow. Vertical clouds, clouds with the prefix "cumulo-," grow vertically instead of horizontally and have their bases at low altitude and their tops at high or middle altitude. Clouds grow vertically when strong air currents are rising upward. Precipitating clouds are nimbus clouds. </p>

        <h3>Fog</h3>
        <p>Fog (Figure 1.3) is a cloud located at or near the ground . When humid air near the ground cools below its dew point, fog is formed. Each type of fog forms in a different way. Radiation fog forms at night when skies are clear and the relative humidity is high. As the ground cools, the bottom layer of air cools below its dew point. Tule fog is an extreme form of radiation fog found in some regions. San Francisco, California, is famous for its summertime advection fog. Warm, moist Pacific Ocean air blows over the cold California current and cools below its dew point. Sea breezes bring the fog onshore. Steam fog appears in autumn when cool air moves over a warm lake. Water evaporates from the lake surface and condenses as it cools, appearing like steam. Warm humid air travels up a hillside and cools below its dew point to create upslope fog. (a) Tule fog in the Central Valley of California. (b) Advection fog in San Francisco. (c) Steam fog over a lake. (d) Upslope fog in Terespolis city, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil. Fog levels are declining along the California coast as climate warms. The change in fog may have big ecological changes for the state. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Air reaches its dew point when humidity increases or temperature decreases. Water droplets form when the air reaches 100% humidity. Clouds block solar radiation, absorb heat from the ground and are the source of snow and rain. Fog forms when there is a difference in temperature between the land and the air. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. Imagine a place with a daytime temperature of 45 degrees F. How will the nighttime temperature change if the sky is cloudy? How will it change if the sky is clear? 2. What set of conditions causes tule fog? 3. The low temperature a few degrees above freezing last night. Why is your car covered with frost this morning? </p>

        <p>Below the stratus, there is steady precipitation whereas below the cumulus, there is showery precipitation. Right below 6,500 ft, there are low clouds and between 6,500 ft and 23,000 ft, there are the middle clouds. It is higher than 23,000 ft where there is the cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus. There is also a halo around the sun.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the common types of clouds in the troposphere. The three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus and cumulus. The types of clouds varies according to how high it is above the ground from 5,000 feet up to 20,000 feet. Because of the cold temperature at high altitudes, clouds are made up of ice crystals. Cloud types can be easily identified by their appearance. Stratus and Cumulus clouds usually form at lower altitudes, clumpy and usually causes rain and precipitation. While Cirrus clouds form at higher altitudes where the temperature is fairly constant and is usually evenly scattered. Clouds play a big role in maintaining the balance of the earth's temperature and has a big impact on the weather. Shown also are Aerosols that stay in the lower atmosphere. Aerosols are produced naturally but recent concerns have been raised since these are largely man-made and Aerosols have significant impacts on cloud and weather system.</p>
