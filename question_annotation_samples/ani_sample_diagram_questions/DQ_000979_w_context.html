        <h3>Solar Eclipses</h3>
        <p>When a new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it causes a solar eclipse (Figure 24.20). The Moon casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun. This happens only all three are lined up and in the same plane. This plane is called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is the plane of Earths orbit around the Sun. The Moons shadow has two distinct parts. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow. It is the part in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Moons shadow. It is where the light is only partially blocked. When the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar eclipse (Figure 24.21). If only part of the Sun is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare events. They usually only last a few minutes. That is because the Moons shadow only covers a very small area on Earth and Earth is turning very rapidly. Solar eclipses are amazing to experience. It appears like night only strange. Birds may sing as they do at dusk. Stars become visible in the sky and it gets colder outside. Unlike at night, the Sun is out. So during a solar eclipse, its easy to see the Suns corona and solar prominences. This NASA page will inform you on when solar eclipses are expected: http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/solar.html </p>

        <h3>A Lunar Eclipse</h3>
        <p>Sometimes a full moon moves through Earths shadow. This is a lunar eclipse (Figure 24.22). During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. When the Moon passes through Earths penumbra, it is a penumbral eclipse. Since Earths shadow is large, a lunar eclipse lasts for hours. Anyone with a view of the Moon can see a lunar eclipse. Partial lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year, but total lunar eclipses are less common. The Moon glows with a dull red coloring during a total lunar eclipse. </p>

        <h3>The Phases of the Moon</h3>
        <p>The Moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light from the Sun. As the Moon moves around the Earth, we see different parts of the Moon lit up by the Sun. This causes the phases of the Moon. As the Moon revolves around Earth, it changes from fully lit to completely dark and back again. A full moon occurs when the whole side facing Earth is lit. This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun. About one week later, the Moon enters the quarter-moon phase. Only half of the Moons lit surface is visible from Earth, so it appears as a half circle. When the Moon moves between Earth and the Sun, the side facing Earth is completely dark. This is called the new moon phase. Sometimes you can just barely make out the outline of the new moon in the sky. This is because some sunlight reflects off the Earth and hits the Moon. Before and after the quarter-moon phases are the gibbous and crescent phases. During the crescent moon phase, the Moon is less than half lit. It is seen as only a sliver or crescent shape. During the gibbous moon phase, the Moon is more than half lit. It is not full. The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days. </p>

        <h3>Review Questions</h3>
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>3. Why do lunar eclipses happen more often and last longer than solar eclipses? 4. The same side of the Moon always faces Earth. What would Earth be like if its same side always faced the Sun? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain solar and lunar eclipses.
Describe the phases of the Moon and explain why they occur.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>When the new moon comes between the Earth and the Sun along the ecliptic, a solar eclipse is produced. When the Earth comes between the full moon and the Sun along the ecliptic, a lunar eclipse occurs. Observing the Moon from Earth, we see a sequence of phases as the side facing us goes from completely darkened to completely illuminated and back again once every 29.5 days. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>5. Why is it a different time in San Francisco and in Denver? Why is the time different in Denver and Chicago? What would things be like if the entire United States decided to have all places be the same time always? 6. People think that Earths season are caused by its elliptical orbit around the Sun. Explain why this is not so. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Why dont eclipses occur every single month at the full and new moons? The planet Mars has a tilt that is very similar to Earths. What does this produce on Mars? Venus comes between the Earth and the Sun. Why dont we see an eclipse when this happens? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Earth, Moon and Sun are linked together in space. Monthly or daily cycles continually remind us of these links. Every month, you can see the Moon change. This is due to where it is relative to the Sun and Earth. In one phase, the Moon is brightly illuminated - a full moon. In the opposite phase it is completely dark - a new moon. In between, it is partially lit up. When the Moon is in just the right position, it causes an eclipse. The daily tides are another reminder of the Moon and Sun. They are caused by the pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth. Tides were discussed in the Oceans chapter. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What is happening with Earth and the Sun during Northern Hemisphere summer? What is happening in the Southern Hemisphere at that time? 2. Draw a picture of Earth, Moon, and Sun during a new moon. Draw picture during a full moon. </p>

        <p>This image shows the different phases of moon. The phases of the Moon are the different ways the Moon looks from Earth over about a month. As the Moon orbits around the Earth, the half of the Moon that faces the Sun will be lit up. The different shapes of the lit portion of the Moon that can be seen from Earth are known as phases of the Moon. A new moon is when the Moon cannot be seen because we are looking at the unlit half of the Moon. A waxing crescent moon is when the Moon looks like crescent and the crescent increases (waxes) in size from one day to the next. The first quarter moon (or a half moon) is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the waxing crescent phase. A waxing gibbous moon occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape increases (waxes) in size from one day to the next. A full moon is when we can see the entire lit portion of the Moon. A waning gibbous moon occurs when more than half of the lit portion of the Moon can be seen and the shape decreases (wanes) in size from one day to the next. The last quarter moon (or a half moon) is when half of the lit portion of the Moon is visible after the waning gibbous phase. A waning crescent moon is when the Moon looks like the crescent and the crescent decreases (wanes) in size from one day to the next.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows 8 phases of the moon. When the side of the moon facing the earth is not illuminated by the Sun the moon phase is called New Moon. When the side of the moon facing the earth is fully lit by the sun, the moon phase is known as Full Moon. The first quarter and last quarter are phases when exactly half of the moon is lit by the sun. The intermediate stages are known as Crescent and Gibbous.</p>

        <p>Illustrated in the diagram are the 8 different phases of the moon. The moon does not produce its own light. However, the moon becomes visible to us due to its capability to reflect light from the sun. As it moves around the Earth, we see these phases that result from the different angles the moon makes with the sun. A New Moon occurs when the side of the moon facing the earth is not illuminated by the sun. After a few days, a thin crescent shape of the moon becomes visible in the night sky. The crescent moon waxes, or appears to grow fatter, each night. When half of the moon is illuminated, it is called a First Quarter moon. The moon continues to wax, forms a gibbous shape, until it eventually becomes a Full Moon. This now means that the moon has completed one half of a month. During the second half, the shape of the moon starts to wane, growing thinner every night. Once the moon reaches the Third Quarter, it shows the other half of its disc that is illuminated by the sun. It continues to wane while nearing its approach to the New Moon Phase. The Moon undergoes a complete cycle of phases about every 29.5 days.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the phases of the moon as it moves in orbit around the earth. Although we can see the moon in the night sky, it does not actually produce its own light. Instead, it reflects the light of the sun onto the earth, much like a mirror would. When the moon is fully lit by the sun, we can see the entire face of the moon. This is called a full moon. However, as the moon moves around its orbit, we see less reflected light due to its changing position. The moon is waning when the reflected surface of the moon is becoming smaller. When we can see only half of the waning moon, we call this the last quarter. When the moon reaches the other side of the earth, it becomes completely dark because the earth blocks the suns light. However, as the moon continues to move around the earth, the suns light will gradually reach the moon again, and the moon reappears in the night sky. The moon is waxing when the reflected surface of the moon is becoming bigger. When we can see half of the waxing moon, we call this the first quarter. The moon will continue to grow until it again becomes a full moon. A full lunar cycle takes about 29.5 days.</p>
