        <h3>Earths Tectonic Plates</h3>
        <p>The Cold War helped scientists to learn more about our planet. They set up seismograph networks during the 1950s and early 1960s. The purpose was to see if other nations were testing atomic bombs. Of course, at the same time, the seismographs were recording earthquakes. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Earthquake Locations</h3>
        <p>The scientists realized that the earthquakes were most common in certain areas. In the oceans, they were found along mid-ocean ridges and deep sea trenches. Earthquakes and volcanoes were common all around the Pacific Ocean. They named this region the Pacific Ring of Fire (Figure 6.13). Earthquakes are also common in the worlds highest mountains, the Himalaya Mountains of Asia. The Mediterranean Sea also has many earthquakes. </p>

        <h3>Earthquakes and Plate Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Earthquakes are used to identify plate boundaries (Figure 6.14). When earthquake locations are put on a map, they outline the plates. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. A few are all continental lithosphere. But </p>

Scientists have determined the direction that each plate is moving (Figure 6.15). Plates move around the Earths surface at a rate of a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow.</p>

        <h3>How Plates Move</h3>
        <p>Convection within the Earths mantle causes the plates to move. Mantle material is heated above the core. The hot mantle rises up towards the surface (Figure 6.16). As the mantle rises it cools. At the surface the material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. The material continues to cool. It sinks back down into the mantle at a deep sea trench. The material sinks back down to the core. It moves horizontally again, completing a convection cell. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 6.16 Plates move for two reasons. Upwelling mantle at the mid-ocean ridge pushes plates outward. Cold lithosphere sinking into the mantle at a subduction zone pulls the rest of the plate down with it.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Plate Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Plate boundaries are where two plates meet. Most geologic activity takes place at plate boundaries. This activity includes volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building. The activity occurs as plates interact. How can plates interact? Plates can move away from each other. They can move toward each other. Finally, they can slide past each other. These are the three types of plate boundaries: Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other. Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other. Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other. The features that form at a plate boundary are determined by the direction of plate motion and by the type of crust at the boundary. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Divergent Plate Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Plates move apart at divergent plate boundaries. This can occur in the oceans or on land. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Midocean Ridges</h3>
        <p>Plates move apart at mid-ocean ridges. Lava rises upward, erupts, and cools. Later, more lava erupts and pushes the original seafloor outward. This is seafloor spreading. Seafloor spreading forms new oceanic crust. The rising magma causes earthquakes. Most mid-ocean ridges are located deep below the sea. The island of Iceland sits right on the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Figure 6.17). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Continental Rifting</h3>
        <p>A divergent plate boundary can also occur within a continent. This is called continental rifting (Figure 6.18). Magma rises beneath the continent. The crust thins, breaks, and then splits apart. This first produces a rift valley. The East African Rift is a rift valley. Eastern Africa is splitting away from the African continent. Eventually, as the continental crust breaks apart, oceanic crust will form. This is how the Atlantic Ocean formed when Pangaea broke up. </p>
        
        <p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Convergent Plate Boundaries</h3>
        <p>A convergent plate boundary forms where two plates collide. That collision can happen between a continent and oceanic crust, between two oceanic plates, or between two continents. Oceanic crust is always destroyed in these collisions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>OceanContinent Convergence</h3>
        <p>Oceanic crust may collide with a continent. The oceanic plate is denser, so it undergoes subduction. This means that the oceanic plate sinks beneath the continent. This occurs at an ocean trench (Figure 6.19). Subduction zones are where subduction takes place. As you would expect, where plates collide there are lots of intense earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The subducting oceanic plate melts as it reenters the mantle. The magma rises and erupts. This creates a volcanic mountain range near the coast of the continent. This range is called a volcanic arc. The Andes Mountains, along the western edge of South America, are a volcanic arc (Figure 6.20). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>OceanOcean Convergence</h3>
        <p>Two oceanic plates may collide. In this case, the older plate is denser. This plate subducts beneath the younger plate. As the subducting plate is pushed deeper into the mantle, it melts. The magma this creates rises and erupts. This forms a line of volcanoes, known as an island arc (Figure 6.21). Japan, Indonesia, the Philippine Islands, and the Aleutian Islands of Alaska are examples of island arcs (Figure 6.22). </p>

        </p>
        <h3>ContinentContinent Convergence</h3>
        <p>Continental lithosphere is low in density and very thick. Continental lithosphere cannot subduct. So when two continental plates collide, they just smash together, just like if you put your hands on two sides of a sheet of paper and bring your hands together. The material has nowhere to go but up (Figure 6.23)! Earthquakes and metamorphic rocks result from the tremendous forces of the collision. But the crust is too thick for magma to get through, so there are no volcanoes. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Transform Plate Boundaries</h3>
        <p>Two plates may slide past each other in opposite directions. This is called a transform plate boundary. These plate boundaries experience massive earthquakes. The worlds best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in California (Figure 6.25). At this fault, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other. Transform plate boundaries are most common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types. At divergent plate boundaries, new oceanic crust is formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed. But at transform plate boundaries, crust is not created or destroyed. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Earths Changing Surface</h3>
        <p>Knowing where plate boundaries are helps explain the locations of landforms and types of geologic activity. The activity can be current or old. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Active Plate Margins</h3>
        <p>Western North America has volcanoes and earthquakes. Mountains line the region. California, with its volcanoes and earthquakes, is an important part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is the boundary between the North American and Pacific Plates. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Passive Plate Margins</h3>
        <p>Mountain ranges also line the eastern edge of North America. But there are no active volcanoes or earthquakes. Where did those mountains come from? These mountains formed at a convergent plate boundary when Pangaea came together. About 200 million years ago these mountains were similar to the Himalayas today (Figure 6.26)! There were also earthquakes. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Supercontinent Cycle</h3>
        <p>Scientists think that Pangaea was not the first supercontinent. There were others before it. The continents are now moving together. This is because of subduction around the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, the Pacific will disappear and a new supercontinent will form. This wont be for hundreds of millions of years. The creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Intraplate Activity</h3>
        <p>Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots. Hotspot volcanoes form as plumes of hot magma rise from deep in the mantle. </p>

        <h3>Hotspots in the Oceans</h3>
        <p>A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away (Figure 6.27). The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most </p>

The Emperor Seamounts are so old they no longer reach above sea level. The oldest of the Emperor Seamounts is about to subduct into the Aleutian trench off of Alaska. Geologists use hotspot chains to tell the direction and the speed a plate is moving.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Hotspots Beneath Continents</h3>
        <p>Hot spots are also found under the continental crust. Since it is more difficult for magma to make it through the thick crust, they are much less common. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot (Figure 6.28). This hotspot is very active. In the past, the hotspot produced enormous volcanic eruptions. Now its activity is best seen in the regions famous geysers. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe what a plate is and how scientists can recognize its edges.
Explain how the plates move by convection in the mantle.
Describe the three types of plate boundaries and the features of each type of boundary.
Describe how plate tectonics processes lead to changes in Earths surface features.

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Convection in the mantle drives the movement of the plates of lithosphere over the Earths surface. New oceanic crust forms at the ridge and pushes the older seafloor away from the ridge horizontally. Plates interact at three different types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent and transform fault bound- aries, where most of the Earths geologic activity takes place. These processes acting over long periods of time are responsible for the geographic features we see. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>3. Make some generalizations about which types of plate boundaries have volcanoes and which have earthquakes. Could you look at a plate boundary and determine what geological activity there would be? 4. Why is continental crust thicker than oceanic crust? Why is oceanic crust relatively thin? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>On the map in Figure 6.15, the arrows show the directions that the plates are going. The Atlantic has a mid- ocean ridge, where seafloor spreading is taking place. The Pacific Ocean has many deep sea trenches, where subduction is taking place. What is the future of the Atlantic plate? What is the future of the Pacific plate? Using your hands and words, explain to someone how plate tectonics works. Be sure you describe how continents drift and how seafloor spreading provides a mechanism for continental movement. Now that you know about plate tectonics, where do you think would be a safe place to live if you wanted to avoid volcanic eruptions and earthquakes? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The theory of plate tectonics explains most of the features of Earths surface. Plate tectonics helps us to understand where and why mountains form. Using the theory, we know where new ocean floor will be created and where it will be destroyed. We know why earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen where they do. We even can search for mineral resources using information about past plate motions. Plate tectonics is the key that unlocks many of the mysteries of our amazing planet. </p>

        <p>The world is made up of tectonic plates. We can understand and learn a great many things about the Earth from studying tectonic plates and their movements. Plate tectonics helps us to understand where and why mountains form. Using the theory, we know where new ocean floor will be created and where it will be destroyed. We know why earthquakes and volcanic eruptions happen where they do. We even can search for mineral resources using information about past plate motions. Plates interact at three levels of boundaries convergent, divergent and transform boundaries, this is where most of the Earths geologic activity takes place. The tectonic plates movements are responsible for most of the geographical features we see around the world.</p>

        <p>The Pacific Plate is the largest tectonic plate. Take a look at the borders of the Pacific Plate, which are dotted by trenches. The Ring of Fire is located in the basin of the Pacific Ocean. Most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur along the Ring of Fire, because it is the location of most of earth's subduction zones. Look at where all the major earthquakes have occurred within the last fifty years. Only one significant fault line has not had a major earthquake in that time span: The Juan de Fuca. Earthquakes have occurred in the last fifty years in all thirteen trenches. Perhaps the next big earthquake will occur along America's Pacific Northwest.</p>

        <p>The diagram below is an example of continent-continent convergence. This means that two tectonic plates are colliding into one another. This creates mountain ranges like the one you see in the middle of the diagram. The geological layers shown in this diagram are continental crust at the top, then lithosphere under it, and then the asthenosphere deeper than that. Also, the diagram shows ancient oceanic crust. This crust has already been subducted under the convergence zone. There are other types of convergence than the one listed in the diagram. There are actually three types total: oceanic-oceanic convergence, oceanic-continental convergence, and continental-continental convergence.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the types of plate margin. Image result for types of plate boundaries There are three kinds of plate tectonic boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform plate boundaries. This image shows the three main types of plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. A divergent boundary occurs when two tectonic plates move away from each other. When two plates come together, it is known as a convergent boundary. Two plates sliding past each other forms a transform plate boundary.</p>
