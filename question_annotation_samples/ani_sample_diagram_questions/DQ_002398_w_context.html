        <h3>Climate Zones and Biomes</h3>
        <p>The major factors that influence climate determine the different climate zones. In general, the same type of climate zone will be found at similar latitudes and in similar positions on nearly all continents, both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The exceptions to this pattern are the climate zones called the continental climates, which are not found at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. This is because the Southern Hemisphere land masses are not wide enough to produce a continental climate. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Classification</h3>
        <p>Climate zones are classified by the Kppen classification system. This system is based on the temperature, the amount of precipitation, and the times of year when precipitation occurs. Since climate determines the type of vegetation that grows in an area, vegetation is used as an indicator of climate type. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Biomes</h3>
        <p>A climate type and its plants and animals make up a biome. The organisms of a biome share certain characteristics around the world, because their environment has similar advantages and challenges. The organisms have adapted to that environment in similar ways over time. For example, different species of cactus live on different continents, but they have adapted to the harsh desert in similar ways. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Major Climate Groups</h3>
        <p>The Kppen classification system recognizes five major climate groups. Each group is divided into subcategories. Some of these subcategories are forest, monsoon, and wet/dry types, based on the amount of precipitation and season when that precipitation occurs (Figure 1.1). This world map of the Kppen classification system indicates where the climate zones and major biomes are located. </p>

        <h3>Tropical Moist Climates</h3>
        <p>Tropical moist climates are found in a band about 15o to 25o N and S of the Equator (Figure 1.1). Temperature: Intense sunshine. Each month has an average temperature of at least 18o C (64o F). Rainfall: Abundant, at least 150 cm (59 inches) per year. The main vegetation for this climate is the tropical rainforest. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Dry Climates</h3>
        <p>Dry climates have less precipitation than evaporation. Temperature: Abundant sunshine. Summer temperatures are high; winters are cooler and longer than in tropical moist climates. Rainfall: Irregular; several years of drought are often followed by a single year of abundant rainfall. Dry climates cover about 26% of the worlds land area. Low latitude deserts are found at the Ferrell cell high pressure zone. Higher latitude deserts occur within continents or in rainshadows. Vegetation is sparse but well adapted to the dry conditions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Moist Subtropical Midlatitude</h3>
        <p>Moist subtropical mid-latitude climates are found along the coastal areas in the United States. Temperature: The coldest month ranges from just below freezing to almost balmy, between -3o C and 18o C (27o to 64o F). Summers are mild, with average temperatures above 10o C (50o F). Seasons are distinct. Rainfall: There is plentiful annual rainfall. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Continental Climates</h3>
        <p>Continental climates are found in most of the North American interior from about 40 N to 70 N. Temperature: The average temperature of the warmest month is higher than 10 C (50 F) and the coldest month is below -3 C (27 F). Precipitation: Winters are cold and stormy (look at the latitude of this zone and see if you can figure out why). Snowfall is common and snow stays on the ground for long periods of time. Trees grow in continental climates, even though winters are extremely cold, because the average annual temperature is fairly mild. Continental climates are not found in the Southern Hemisphere because of the absence of a continent large enough to generate this effect. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Polar Climates</h3>
        <p>Polar climates are found across the continents that border the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, and Antarctica. Temperature: Winters are entirely dark and bitterly cold. Summer days are long, but the Sun is low on the horizon so summers are cool. The average temperature of the warmest month is less than 10o C (50o F). The annual temperature range is large. Precipitation: The region is dry, with less than 25 cm (10 inches) of precipitation annually; most precipitation occurs during the summer. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Microclimates</h3>
        <p>When climate conditions in a small area are different from those of the surroundings, the climate of the small area is called a microclimate. The microclimate of a valley may be cool relative to its surroundings since cold air sinks. The ground surface may be hotter or colder than the air a few feet above it, because rock and soil gain and lose heat readily. Different sides of a mountain will have different microclimates. In the Northern Hemisphere, a south-facing slope receives more solar energy than a north-facing slope, so each side supports different amounts and types of vegetation. Altitude mimics latitude in climate zones. Climates and biomes typical of higher latitudes may be found in other areas of the world at high altitudes. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>A biome is a climate zone and the plants and animals that live in it. The Koppen classification system divides climates into five major types and many subtypes based on temper- ature and humidity characteristics. A microclimate has different climate conditions from the surrounding regions. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. How does a biome relate to a climate zone? 2. How does a region develop its own microclimate? 3. Where do you think dry climates are located? Where are subtropical climates located? </p>

        <p>The diagram shows a biome pyramid. It consists of four regions: Arctic region, Subarctic region, Temperate region and Tropical region. The Arctic region consists of Tundra. The Subarctic region consists of Boreal forest. The Temperate region consists of Temperate forest, Grassland, Chapparal, and Desert. The Tropical region consists of Tropical forest, Grassland, and Desert. The temperature and the dryness of a place decide its region. As the temperature increases, there is a change in the different regions. The hottest and driest region is the Desert. The coldest and the driest region is the Tundra. The coldest and the least dry region is the Tropical forest.</p>

        <p>This is a map showing where different biomes are found around the world. A biome can be defined a group of similar ecosystems with sharing abiotic factors and primary producers. In this map we can see bands of color stretching East to West, showing how similar latitudes often share similar biomes. Near the equator we see deserts and rainforests. In the North we see tundra and taiga. Most of central Europe is temperate broadleaf forest. In USA we see mostly temperate forest in the East, temperate steppe in the middle, and in the West there is a lot of montane forest as well as arid desert.</p>

        <p>This is a map showing ten different biomes and where they can be found in on a world map. A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. The oceans on the map are all classified as marine biomes, while the rivers and lakes are freshwater biomes. The northernmost parts of North America, Europe, and Asia are ice, tundra, and taiga biomes. The central parts of North America, Europe, and Asia are classified as grassland and temperate forest. The southern parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as the northern parts of Africa, are classified as savana, desert, and temperate forest. South America and the south eastern part of Africa are classified as tropical rainforest, desert, and savana. Australia is made up mostly of desert and grassland. Antarctica is entirely iced.</p>
