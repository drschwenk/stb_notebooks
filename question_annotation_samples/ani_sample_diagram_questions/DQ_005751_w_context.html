        <h3>Structure of the Skin</h3>
        <p>From the outside, the skin looks plain and simple, as you can see in Figure 16.5. But at a cellular level, theres nothing plain or simple about it. A single square inch of skin contains about 20 blood vessels, hundreds of sweat glands, and more than a thousand nerve endings. It also contains tens of thousands of pigment-producing cells. Clearly, there is much more to skin than meets the eye! For a dramatic introduction to the skin, watch this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The skin is only about 2 mm thick, or about as thick as the cover of a book. Although it is very thin, it consists of two distinct layers, called the epidermis and the dermis. You can see both layers and some of their structures in Figure 16.6. Refer to the figure as you read about the epidermis and dermis below. </p>

        <h3>Epidermis</h3>
        <p>The epidermis is the outer layer of skin. It consists almost entirely of epithelial cells. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings, or glands in this skin layer. Nonetheless, this layer of skin is very active. It is constantly being renewed. How does this happen? 1. The cells at the bottom of the epidermis are always dividing by mitosis to form new cells. 2. The new cells gradually move up through the epidermis toward the surface of the body. As they move, they produce the tough, fibrous protein called keratin. 3. By the time the cells reach the surface, they have filled with keratin and died. On the surface, the dead cells form a protective, waterproof layer. 4. Dead cells are gradually shed from the surface of the epidermis. As they are shed, they are replaced by other dead cells that move up from below. The epidermis also contains cells called melanocytes. You can see a melanocyte in Figure 16.7. Melanocytes produce melanin. Melanin is a brown pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyones skin has about the same number of melanocytes per square inch. However, the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin that is produced depends partly on your genes and partly on how much ultraviolet light strikes your skin. The more light you get, the more melanin your melanocytes produce. This explains why skin tans when its exposed to sunlight. </p>

        <h3>Dermis</h3>
        <p>The dermis is the inner layer of skin. It is made of tough connective tissue. The dermis is attached to the epidermis by fibers made of the protein collagen. The dermis is where most skin structures are located. Look again at Figure pain, pressure, and temperature. If you cut your skin and it bleeds, the cut has penetrated the dermis and damaged a blood vessel. The cut probably hurts as well because of the nerve endings in this skin layer. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands. You can see some of these structures in Figure 16.8. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. Sweat glands produce the salty fluid known as sweat. Sweat contains excess water, salts, and other waste products. Each sweat gland has a duct that passes through the epidermis. Sweat travels from the gland through the duct and out through a pore on the surface of the skin. </p>

        <h3>Skin Functions</h3>
        <p>You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. In several ways, it helps maintain homeostasis. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. Melanin in the epidermis absorbs ultraviolet light. This prevents the light from reaching and damaging the dermis. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, increasing blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface and radiate into the environment. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, decreasing blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface so less heat is lost to the environment. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Keeping Skin Healthy</h3>
        <p>What can you do to keep your skin healthy? The most important step you can take is to protect your skin from sun exposure. On sunny days, wear long sleeves and pants and a hat with a brim. Also apply sunscreen to exposed areas of skin. Protecting your skin in these ways will reduce damage to your skin by ultraviolet light. This is important because skin that has been damaged by ultraviolet light is at greater risk of developing skin cancer. This is true whether the damage is due to sunlight or the light in tanning beds. About 85 percent of teens develop acne, like the boy in Figure 16.9. Acne is a condition in which pimples form on the skin. It is caused by a bacterial infection. It happens when the sebaceous glands secrete too much sebum. The excess oil provides a good place for bacteria to grow. Keeping the skin clean helps prevent acne. Over-the-counter products or prescription drugs may be needed if the problem is serious or doesnt clear up on its own. </p>

        <h3>Hair and Nails</h3>
        <p>You may spend a lot of time and money on your hair and nails. You may think of them as accessories, like clothes or jewelry. However, like the skin, the hair and nails also play important roles in helping the body maintain homeostasis. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Hair</h3>
        <p>Only mammals have hair. Hair is a fiber made mainly of the tough protein keratin. The cells of each hair are filled with keratin and no longer alive. The dead cells overlap each other, almost like shingles on a roof. They work like shingles as well, by helping shed water from hair. Head hair helps protect the scalp from sun exposure. It also helps insulate the body. It traps air so heat cant escape from the head. Hair in eyelashes and eyebrows helps keep water and dust out of the eyes. Hairs inside the nostrils of the nose trap dust and germs in the air so they cant reach the lungs. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nails</h3>
        <p>Fingernails and toenails are made of specialized cells that grow out of the epidermis. They too are filled with keratin. The keratin makes them tough and hard. Their job is to protect the ends of the fingers and toes. They also make it easier to feel things with the sensitive fingertips by acting as a counterforce when things are handled. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The integumentary system consists of the skin, hair, and nails. All three organs provide a protective covering for the body and help maintain homeostasis. The skin consists of two distinct layers, an outer layer called the epidermis and an inner layer called the dermis. The epidermis is constantly being renewed as dead cells on the surface are shed. This layer contains melanin- producing melanocytes. The dermis contains blood vessels, nerve endings, hair follicles, and sebaceous and sweat glands. The skin prevents loss of water from the body and keeps out microorganisms. Melanin in the epidermis protects the dermis from damaging ultraviolet light. By dilating or contracting its blood vessels and releasing sweat, skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. The most important way to keep your skin healthy is to protect it from ultraviolet light. Over-exposure to ultraviolet light can cause skin cancer. Keeping the skin clean can help prevent acne. Head hair protects the scalp from ultraviolet light exposure and loss of body heat. Hair in eyelashes, eyebrows, and nostrils traps water, dust, and other irritants. Nails protect the ends of fingers and toes and enhance the sense of touch. </p>

        <p>This is the diagram of an active hair follicle. A hair follicle is a mammalian skin organ that produces hair. Hair production occurs in phases, including growth (anagen), cessation (catagen), and rest (telogen) phases. Stem cells are responsible for hair production. The shape of the hair follicle has an effect on the hair shape and texture of the individual's hair. The papilla is a large structure at the base of the hair follicle. The dermal papilla is made up mainly of connective tissue and a capillary loop. Cell division in the papilla is either rare or non-existent. Around the papilla is the germinal matrix. The root sheath is composed of an external and internal root sheath. Other structures associated with the hair follicle include the cup in which the follicle grows known as the sebaceous glands. Hair follicle receptors sense the position of the hair.</p>

        <p>This picture shows the layers and structure of the skin. The skin is made up of two distinct layers called the epidermis and dermis. The upper layer of the skin is called the epidermis. It is thick and tough and forms a protective layer. The epidermis consists of cells that contain a lot of keratin. The cells of the epidermis also contains cells that produce melanin which is the pigment that gives the skin much of its color. Below the epidermis, is the dermis. It is made of tough connective tissue. The dermis contains the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Sebaceous glands are commonly called oil glands. They produce an oily substance called sebum. Sebum is secreted into hair follicles. Then it makes its way along the hair shaft to the surface of the skin. Sebum waterproofs the hair and skin and helps prevent them from drying out. The red string like object in the diagram is the arrector pili muscle. It is a small muscle connecting a hair follicle to the dermis that contracts to make the hair stand erect in response to cold or fear.</p>

        <p>The image below shows the Layers and structures of the skin. Skin has three layers: The epidermis, the outermost layer of skin, provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone. Below the dermis lies a layer of fat that helps insulate the body from heat and cold, provides protective padding, and serves as an energy storage area. The fat is contained in living cells, called fat cells, held together by fibrous tissue.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the layers and structures of the skin. Skin, glands, hair and nails belong to the Integumentary System. This system serves as a protective barrier that prevents internal body parts from exposure to harmful elements like ultraviolet light, extreme temperature and toxins. The skin covers the entire external surface of the human body and thus, it is the major organ of the Integumentary System. Skin has three main layers: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The outermost layer of the skin is the epidermis. There are no blood vessels, nerve endings, or glands in this skin layer. Nonetheless, this layer of skin is very active. It contains melanocytes that produce melanin, a brown pigment which gives the skin its color. Attached under the epidermis is the more complex structure called the dermis. This layer contains nerve endings, blood vessels and two types of glands, the sebaceous and sweat glands. The sweat produced by these glands travels out of the body through a pore on the surface of the skin. Sebaceous glands produce sebum which waterproofs the hair. Hair follicles, where hairs originate, are also found in the dermis. Each hair grows out of a follicle, passes up through the epidermis, and extends above the skin surface. Lastly, the hypodermis is the deepest layer of the skin which contains cells that serve as fat and energy storage for the body's use.</p>
