        <h3>What Are Nucleic Acids</h3>
        <p>Nucleic acids are one of four classes of biochemical compounds. (The other three classes are carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.) Nucleic acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) as well as DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Both types of nucleic acids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Q: Which of the elements in DNA is not identified with any other class of biochemical compounds? A: All biochemical compounds contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and proteins as well as nucleic acids contain nitrogen. Phosphorus is the only element that is identified with nucleic acids. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nucleotides</h3>
        <p>Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides, which are held together by covalent bonds. The structure of a nucleotide is shown in the Figure 1.1. Each nucleotide consists of: 1. a phosphate group, which contains phosphorus and oxygen (PO4 ). 2. a sugar, which is deoxyribose (C5 H8 O4 ) in DNA and ribose (C5 H10 O5 ) in RNA. 3. one of four nitrogen-containing bases. (A base is a compound that is not neither acidic nor neutral.) In DNA, the bases are adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. RNA has the base uracil instead of thymine, but the other three bases are the same. </p>

        <h3>The Double Helix</h3>
        <p>RNA consists of just one chain of nucleotides. DNA consists of two chains. Nitrogen bases on the two chains of DNA form hydrogen bonds with each other. Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak bonds that form between a positively charged hydrogen atom in one molecule and a negatively charged atom in another molecule. Hydrogen bonds form only between adenine and thymine, and between guanine and cytosine. These bonds hold the two chains together and give DNA is characteristic double helix, or spiral, shape. You can see the shape of the DNA molecule in the Figure 1.2. Sugars and phosphate groups form the backbone of each chain of DNA. The bonded bases are called base pairs. Determining the structure of DNA was a huge scientific breakthrough. Q: Compare the structure of DNA to a spiral staircase. What part of the molecule do the stair steps represent? A: The steps represent the base pairs. </p>

        <h3>Functions of Nucleic Acids</h3>
        <p>DNA stores genetic information in the cells of all living things. It contains the genetic code. This is the code that instructs cells how to make proteins. The instructions are encoded in the sequence of nitrogen bases in the nucleotide chains of DNA. RNA copies and interprets the genetic code in DNA and is also involved in the synthesis of proteins based on the code. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: DNA is found only in the nucleus of cells, but proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm of cells, outside of the nucleus. How do you think the instructions encoded in DNA reach the cytoplasm so they can be used to make proteins? A: After RNA copies the instructions in DNA, it carries them from the nucleus to a site of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm, where the instructions are translated into a protein. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>1. Nucleic acids are one of four classes of biochemical molecules. Nucleic acids include RNA (ribonucleic acid) and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). 2. Nucleic acids consist of chains of small molecules called nucleotides, which are held together by covalent bonds. 3. RNA is made of one nucleotide chain, and DNA is made of two. The two chains of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds in the shape of a double helix. 4. DNA contains the genetic code, which instructs cells how to make proteins. RNA copies the genetic code in DNA and helps synthesize proteins based on the code. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which carries the genetic information of organisms. DNA is made up of a double helix of two complementary strands. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel with one being 5' to 3', and the opposite strand 3' to 5'. Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of nucleotides. The four types of nucleotide correspond to the four nucleobases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine, commonly abbreviated as A, C, G and T. Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three hydrogen bonds). During DNA replication, the parent DNA unwinds and each parental strand serves as a template for replication of new strands. Nucleobases are matched to synthesize the new daughter strands.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the structure of a DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. Deoxyribonucleic acid is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. Most DNA molecules consist of two strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing compounds either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T). The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone.</p>
