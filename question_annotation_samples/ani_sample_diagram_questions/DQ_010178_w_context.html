        <h3>Copying DNA</h3>
        <p>DNA stands for deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a very large molecule. It consists of two strands of smaller molecules called nucleotides. Before learning how DNA is copied, its a good idea to review its structure. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>DNA Structure</h3>
        <p>As you can see in Figure 5.1, each nucleotide includes a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogen base. The sugar in DNA is called deoxyribose. There are four different nitrogen bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Chemical bonds between the bases hold the two strands of DNA together. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine. These pairs of bases are called complementary base pairs. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>Chromosomes</h3>
        <p>As a cell prepares to divide, its DNA first forms one or more structures called chromosomes. A chromosome consists of DNA and protein molecules coiled into a definite shape. Chromosomes are circular in prokaryotes and rodlike in eukaryotes. You can see an example of a human chromosome in Figure below. The rest of the time, DNA looks like a tangled mass of strings. In this form, it would be very difficult to copy and divide. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>DNA Replication</h3>
        <p>The process in which DNA is copied is called DNA replication. You can see how it happens in Figure 5.3. An enzyme breaks the bonds between the two DNA strands. Another enzyme pairs new, complementary nucleotides with those in the original chains. Two daughter DNA molecules form. Each contains one new chain and one original chain. </p>

        <h3>Cell Division in Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells</h3>
        <p>How cell division proceeds depends on whether a cell has a nucleus. Prokaryotic cells lack a nucleus. Their DNA is in the cytoplasm. It forms just one circular chromosome. Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus holding their DNA. Their DNA forms multiple rodlike chromosomes, like the one in Figure 5.2. Eukaryotic cells also have other organelles. For these reasons, cell division is more complex in eukaryotic cells. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Prokaryotic Cell Division</h3>
        <p>You can see how a prokaryotic cell divides in Figure 5.4. This type of cell division is called binary fission. The cell simply splits into two equal halves. Binary fission occurs in bacteria and other prokaryotes. It takes place in three continuous steps: 1. The cells chromosome is copied to form two identical chromosomes. This is DNA replication. 2. The copies of the chromosome separate from each other. They move to opposite poles, or ends, of the cell. This is called chromosome segregation. 3. The cell wall grows toward the center of the cell. The cytoplasm splits apart, and the cell pinches in two. This is called cytokinesis. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Eukaryotic Cell Division</h3>
        <p>Before a eukaryotic cell divides, the nucleus and other organelles must be copied. Only then will each daughter cell have all the needed structures. 1. The first step in eukaryotic cell division, as it is in prokaryotic cell division, is DNA replication. As you can see in Figure 5.5, each chromosome then consists of two identical copies. The two copies are called sister chromatids. They are attached to each other at a point called the centromere. 2. The second step in eukaryotic cell division is division of the cells nucleus. This includes division of the chromosomes. This step is called mitosis. It is a complex process that occurs in four phases. The phases of mitosis are described below. 3. The third step is the division of the rest of the cell. This is called cytokinesis, as it is in a prokaryotic cell. During this step, the cytoplasm divides, and two daughter cells form. These three steps are shown in Figure 5.6. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mitosis</h3>
        <p>Mitosis, or division of the nucleus, occurs only in eukaryotic cells. By the time mitosis occurs, the cells DNA has already replicated. Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. You can see what happens in each phase in Figure below. The phases are described below. You can also learn more about the phases of mitosis by watching this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  1. Prophase: Chromosomes form, and the nuclear membrane breaks down. In animal cells, the centrioles near the nucleus move to opposite poles of the cell. Fibers called spindles form between the centrioles. 2. Metaphase: Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the sister chromatids. The sister chromatids line up at the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase: Spindle fibers shorten, pulling the sister chromatids toward the opposite poles of the cell. This gives each pole a complete set of chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The chromosomes uncoil, and the spindle fibers break down. New nuclear membranes form. </p>

        <h3>The Cell Cycle</h3>
        <p>Cell division is just one of the stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime. All of the stages that a cell goes through make up the cell cycle. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Prokaryotic Cell Cycle</h3>
        <p>The cell cycle of a prokaryotic cell is simple. The cell grows in size, its DNA replicates, and the cell divides. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Eukaryotic Cell Cycle</h3>
        <p>In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated. The diagram in Figure 5.7 shows the stages that a eukaryotic cell goes through in its lifetime. There are two main stages: interphase and mitotic phase. They are described below. You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through the phases of the cell cycle at this link:  Interphase is longer than mitotic phase. Interphase, in turn, is divided into three phases: Mitotic phase is when the cell divides. It includes mitosis (M) and cytokinesis (C). </p>

It makes proteins needed for DNA replication and copies some of its organelles. A cell usually spends most of its lifetime in this phase. 2. Synthesis phase (S): The cell copies its DNA. This is DNA replication. 3. Growth phase 2 (G2): The cell gets ready to divide. It makes more proteins and copies the rest of its organelles.</p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>DNA is the nucleic acid that stores genetic information. It must be copied before a cell divides. DNA replication is the process in which DNA is copied. Cell division is the process in which a parent cell divides to form two daughter cells. It occurs by binary fusion in most prokaryotic cells. It is more complex in eukaryotic cells. Mitosis is the process by which the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell divides. It happens in four phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Cell division is just one stage of the cell cycle. The cell cycle includes all of the stages in the life of a cell. The cell cycle is more complex in eukaryotic than prokaryotic cells. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Cell division is the process in which a cell divides to form two new cells. The original cell is called the parent cell. The two new cells are called daughter cells. All cells contain DNA. DNA is the nucleic acid that stores genetic information. Before a cell divides its DNA must be copied. That way, each daughter cell gets a complete copy of the parent cells genetic material. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows two types of cell division process called mitosis (on the left) and meiosis (on the right). Both types of cell division result in the division of the original cell called the parent cell but the difference is that mitosis a cell splits to create two identical copies of the original cell. In meiosis, cells split to form new cells with half the usual number of chromosomes, to produce gametes for sexual reproduction. The two cell division process share a number of stages e.g. doubling of DNA, assembly in center of cell, separation of chromosomes and finally cell division.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the process of Meiosis of cells. Five stages are involved in the process of Meiosis. Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half. Meiosis begins with a diploid cell, which contains two copies of each chromosome. In meiosis, DNA replication is followed by Pairing and Recombination. After this, the cell goes through two rounds of cell division, called Meiosis I and Meiosis II. These stages produce four potential daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the original parent cell. During Meiosis II, sister chromatids decouple and the resultant daughter chromosomes are segregated into four daughter cells.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the process of cell division known a mitosis. Mitosis has 5 distinct phases. The interphase is the first phase followed by prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. In the final phase, the Telophase, the cell divides into two new cells.</p>

        <p>The diagram is a representation of the cell cycle. The cell cycle consists of four discrete phases: G1, S, G2, and M. The S or synthesis phase is when DNA replication occurs, and the M or mitosis phase is when the cell actually divides. The other two phases G1 and G2, the so-called gap phases are less dramatic but equally important. During G1, the cell conducts a series of checks before entering the S phase. Later, during G2, the cell similarly checks its readiness to proceed to mitosis. Together, the G1, S, and G2 phases make up the period known as interphase. Cells typically spend far more time in interphase than they do in mitosis. Of the four phases, G1 is most variable in terms of duration, although it is often the longest portion of the cell cycle. Mitosis consists of four basic phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. These phases occur in strict sequential order, and cytokinesis-the process of dividing the cell contents to make two new cells-starts in anaphase or telophase.</p>

During the interphase, the cell grows and prepares to divide into daughter cells. The interphase has three main sub-phases. The G1 phase, or the first growth phase, is the longest phase. During G1, the cell grows rapidly. In addition to carrying out its basic cell functions, it also copies some of its organelles and creates the proteins it will need to replicate its DNA. The second phase is called the S stage, or the synthesis phase. During this phase, the cell copies its DNA. This is called DNA replication. The third phase is the second growth phase, or the G2 stage. During G2, the cell prepares for mitosis by making more proteins and copying the rest of its organelles. During the mitotic phase, the cell nucleus divides into two. Each new nucleus then becomes its own cell, forming two daughter cells. This process is called mitosis.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the Eukaryotic cell Cycle. The division cycle of most cells consists of four coordinated processes: cell growth, DNA replication, distribution of the duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells, and cell division. In bacteria, cell growth and DNA replication take place throughout most of the cell cycle, and duplicated chromosomes are distributed to daughter cells in association with the plasma membrane. In eukaryotes, however, the cell cycle is more complex and consists of four discrete phases. Although cell growth is usually a continuous process, DNA is synthesized during only one phase of the cell cycle, and the replicated chromosomes are then distributed to daughter nuclei by a complex series of events preceding cell division. Progression between these stages of the cell cycle is controlled by a conserved regulatory apparatus, which not only coordinates the different events of the cell cycle but also links the cell cycle with extracellular signals that control cell proliferation.</p>
