        <h3>Making Glucose</h3>
        <p>Chemical energy that organisms need comes from food. The nearly universal food for life is the sugar glucose. Glucose is a simple carbohydrate with the chemical formula C6 H12 O6 . The glucose molecule stores chemical energy in a concentrated, stable form. In your body, glucose is the form of energy that is carried in your blood and taken up by each of your trillions of cells. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>What Is Photosynthesis</h3>
        <p>What is the source of glucose for living things? It is made by plants and certain other organisms. The process in which glucose is made using energy in light is photosynthesis. This process requires carbon dioxide and water. It produces oxygen in addition to glucose. Photosynthesis consists of many chemical reactions. Overall, the reactions of photosynthesis can be summed up by this chemical equation: 6CO2 + 6H2 O + light energy ! C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 In words, this means that six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2 ) combine with six molecules of water (H2 O) in the presence of light energy. This produces one molecule of glucose (C6 H12 O6 ) and six molecules of oxygen (O2 ).

        <h3>Autotrophs vs. Heterotrophs</h3>
        <p>Types of organisms that make glucose by photosynthesis are pictured in Figure 4.7. They include plants, plant-like protists such as algae, and some kinds of bacteria. Living things that make glucose are called autotrophs ("self feeders"). All other living things obtain glucose by eating autotrophs (or organisms that eat autotrophs). These living things are called heterotrophs ("other feeders"). </p>

        <h3>Site of Photosynthesis The Chloroplast</h3>
        <p>In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. (Photosynthetic bacteria have other structures for this purpose.) A chloroplast is a type of plastid, or plant organelle. It contains the green pigment known as chlorophyll. The presence of chloroplasts in plant cells is one of the major ways they differ from animal cells. You can see chloroplasts in plant cells Figure 4.8. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Chloroplast Structure</h3>
        <p>The structure of a chloroplast is shown in Figure 4.9. The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes. Inside the chloroplast are stacks of flattened sacs of membrane, called thylakoids. The thylakoids contain chlorophyll. Surrounding the thylakoids is a space called the stroma. The stroma is filled with watery ("aqueous") fluid. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How the Chloroplast Gets Raw Materials</h3>
        <p>In plants, most chloroplasts are found in the leaves. Therefore, all the raw materials needed for photosynthesis must be present in the leaves. These materials include light, water, and carbon dioxide. The shape of the leaves gives them a lot of surface area to absorb light for photosynthesis. Roots take up water from the soil. Stems carry the water from the roots to the leaves. Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through tiny openings called stomata. (The oxygen released during photosynthesis also exits the leaves through the stomata.) </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Stages of Photosynthesis</h3>
        <p>Photosynthesis occurs in two stages, called the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. Figure 4.10 sums up what happens in these two stages. Both stages are described below. </p>
        
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Light Reactions</h3>
        <p>The light reactions occur in the first stage of photosynthesis. This stage takes place in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast. In the light reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll. This energy is temporarily transferred to two molecules: ATP and NADPH. These molecules are used to store the energy for the second stage of photosynthesis. The light reactions use water and produce oxygen. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Calvin Cycle</h3>
        <p>The Calvin cycle occurs in the second stage of photosynthesis. This stage takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast. In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is used to produce glucose (sugar) using the energy stored in ATP and NADPH. The energy is released from these molecules when ATP loses phosphate (Pi ) to become ADP and NADPH loses hydrogen (H) to become NADP+ . </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. A plant in a pot of soil is placed in bright sunlight for 12 hours a day. The plant is located near an open window with good air circulation. If the plant is left alone for a month, will it produce glucose? Why or why not? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Define photosynthesis, and identify photosynthetic organisms.
Describe the chloroplast and its role in photosynthesis.
Outline what happens during the two stages of photosynthesis.
</p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Most living things use glucose for energy. The process in which glucose is made using light energy is photosynthesis. Water and carbon dioxide are needed for this process, and oxygen is produced as a byproduct. Photosynthetic organisms include plants, algae, and some bacteria. In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain stacks of membranes called thylakoids, which contain chlorophyll. Thylakoids are surrounded by a fluid-filled space called stroma. Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. The light reactions take place in the thylakoids. They capture light energy. The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma. It uses the energy to produce glucose from carbon dioxide. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>All living things need energy. You can often see energy at work in living things. Look at the hummingbird and jellyfish in Figure 4.6. Both of them are obviously using energy. Living things constantly use energy in less obvious ways as well. Inside every cell, all living things need energy to carry out life processes. Life runs on chemical energy. Where does this chemical energy come from? </p>

        <p>This diagram depicts photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process in which plants synthesize glucose. The process uses carbon dioxide and water and also produces oxygen. The plant gets energy from sunlight using a green pigment called chlorophyll. Photosynthesis changes light energy to chemical energy. The chemical energy is stored in the bonds of glucose molecules. Glucose is used for energy by the cells of almost all living things. Plants make their own glucose.</p>

        <p>This diagram represents photosynthesis. Photosynthesis the process in which plants synthesizes glucose. During photosynthesis, it gets its energy from the sun (light energy.) Photosynthesis changes light energy (the energy the plant receives from the sun) to chemical energy. This process uses carbon dioxide and water. In return, it produces oxygen and carbohydrates. It does this by the energy it receives from the sun. The equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2 O + Light Energy C6 H12 O6 + 6O2.</p>
