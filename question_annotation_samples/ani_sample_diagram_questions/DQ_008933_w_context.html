        <h3>Biogeochemical Cycles</h3>
        <p>The chemical elements and water that are needed by living things keep recycling on Earth. They pass back and forth through biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. Thats why their cycles are called biogeochemical cycles. For example, a chemical element or water might move from organisms (bio) to the atmosphere or ocean (geo) and back to organisms again. Elements or water may be held for various periods of time in different parts of a biogeochemical cycle. An exchange pool is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a short period of time. For example, the atmosphere is an exchange pool for water. It usually holds water (as water vapor) for just a few days. A reservoir is part of a cycle that holds a substance for a long period of time. For example, the ocean is a reservoir for water. It may hold water for thousands of years. The rest of this lesson describes three biogeochemical cycles: water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Water Cycle</h3>
        <p>Water is an extremely important aspect of every ecosystem. Life cant exist without water. Most organisms contain a large amount of water, and many live in water. Therefore, the water cycle is essential to life on Earth. Water on Earth is billions of years old. However, individual water molecules keep moving through the water cycle. The water cycle is a global cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface, as shown in Figure 24.7. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle.

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Evaporation Sublimation and Transpiration</h3>
        <p>Water changes to a gas by three different processes called evaporation, sublimation, and transpiration. Evaporation takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and gives water molecules enough energy to escape into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Condensation and Precipitation</h3>
        <p>Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. It includes rain, snow, sleet, hail, and freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers. These masses of ice can store frozen water for hundreds of years or even longer. Condensation may also form fog or dew. Some living things, like the lizard in Figure 24.8, depend directly on these sources of liquid water. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Runoff and Groundwater</h3>
        <p>Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. It may eventually flow into a body of water. Some precipitation that falls on land soaks into the ground. This water becomes groundwater. Groundwater may seep out of the ground at a spring or into a body of water such as the ocean. Some groundwater is taken up by plant roots. Some may flow deeper underground to an aquifer. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that stores water. Water may be stored in an aquifer for thousands of years. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carbon Cycle</h3>
        <p>The element carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Biochemical compounds consist of chains of carbon atoms and just a few other elements. Like water, carbon is constantly recycled through the biotic and abiotic factors of ecosystems. The carbon cycle includes carbon in sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels under the ground, the ocean, the atmosphere, and living things. The diagram in Figure 24.9 represents the carbon cycle. It shows some of the ways that carbon moves between the different parts of the cycle. You can see an animated carbon cycle at this link: http://commons.w </p>

        <h3>Carbon Reservoirs</h3>
        <p>Major reservoirs of carbon include sedimentary rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean. Sediments from dead organisms may form carbon-containing sedimentary rocks. Alternatively, the sediments may form carbon-rich fossil fuels, which include oil, natural gas, and coal. Carbon can be stored in these reservoirs for millions of years. However, if fossil fuels are extracted and burned, the stored carbon enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions, can also release underground carbon from rocks into the atmosphere. Water erosion by runoff, rivers, and streams dissolves carbon in rocks and carries it to the ocean. Ocean water near the surface dissolves carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Dissolved carbon may be stored in the deep ocean for thousands of years. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carbon Exchange Pools</h3>
        <p>Major exchange pools of carbon include organisms and the atmosphere. Carbon cycles more quickly between these components of the carbon cycle. Photosynthesis by plants and other producers removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make organic compounds for living things. Cellular respiration by living things releases carbon into the atmosphere or ocean as carbon dioxide. Decomposition of dead organisms and organic wastes releases carbon back to the atmosphere, soil, or ocean. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nitrogen Cycle</h3>
        <p>Nitrogen is another common element found in living things. It is needed to form both proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. Nitrogen gas makes up 78 percent of Earths atmosphere. In the nitrogen cycle, nitrogen flows back and forth between the atmosphere and living things. You can see how it happens in Figure 24.10. Several different types of bacteria play major roles in the cycle. Animals get nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms that eat plants. Where do plants get nitrogen? They cant use nitrogen gas in the air. The only form of nitrogen that plants can use is in chemical compounds called nitrates. Plants absorb nitrates through their roots. This is called assimilation. Most of the nitrates are produced by bacteria that live in soil or in the roots of plants called legumes. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria change nitrogen gas from the atmosphere to nitrates in soil. When organisms die and decompose, their nitrogen is returned to the soil as ammonium ions. Nitrifying bacteria change some of the ammonium ions into nitrates. The other ammonium ions are changed into nitrogen gas by denitrifying bacteria. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Water and chemical elements that organisms need keep recycling through biogeochemical cycles. These cycles include biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems. The water cycle includes the ocean, atmosphere, ground, and living things. During the water cycle, water keeps changing state by processes such as evaporation, transpiration, condensation, and precipitation. The carbon cycle includes photosynthesis, in which plants change carbon dioxide to organic compounds. It also includes cellular respiration, in which living things burn organic compounds and release carbon dioxide. Rocks, fossil fuels, and the ocean are also part of the carbon cycle. Bacteria play important roles in the nitrogen cycle. They change nitrogen gas and products of decomposition into nitrates, which plants can assimilate. Animals obtain nitrogen by eating plants or other organisms. Still other bacteria return nitrogen gas to the atmosphere. </p>

        <p>Where does the water come from that is needed by your cells? What is the source of the carbon and nitrogen that are needed to make your organic molecules? These forms of matter are recycled in an ecosystem. Unlike energy, matter is not lost as it passes through an ecosystem. It just keeps cycling. </p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the water cycle, which is an important part of the ecosystem. The water in the water cycle exists in three different phases, liquid, solid (ice) and gas (water vapor). Water from lakes and oceans evaporates and is carried by rising air currents in the atmosphere. In the atmosphere the water vapor condenses and forms tiny droplets of water that form clouds. When the droplets get big enough the water comes back to earth in the form of precipitation. Precipitation can be in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Eventually the water evaporates again and the cycle starts over. Water can also enter the atmosphere through trees and plants from a process called transpiration.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the processes of the water cycle. It takes place on, above, and below Earths surface. During the water cycle, water occurs in three different states: gas (water vapor), liquid (water), and solid (ice). Many processes are involved as water changes state to move through the cycle. One of the processes is called Evaporation. It takes place when water on Earths surface changes to water vapor. The sun heats the water and turns it into water vapor which escapes up into the atmosphere. Most evaporation occurs from the surface of the ocean. Sublimation is another process takes place when snow and ice on Earths surface change directly to water vapor without first melting to form liquid water. This also happens because of heat from the sun. Transpiration is yet another process that takes place when plants release water vapor through pores in their leaves called stomata. As the water vapor rises up into the earth's atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process of converting water vapor into water droplets. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation. Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the atmosphere. Precipitation that falls on land may flow over the surface of the ground. This water is called runoff. The runoff may reach a water body such as an ocean or get soaked into the ground.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the water cycle. Water from lakes, streams, rivers, and other bodies of water evaporates and turns into clouds. This leads to condensation which leads to precipitation in the form of rain and snow. Some precipitation adds to the bodies of water and some goes into the ground. The water that goes into the ground is called ground water--some of it eventually makes its way to bodies of water. Water also can come down from mountains and end up in bodies of water--this is called runoff.</p>
