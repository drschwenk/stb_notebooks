        <h3>The Rock Cycle</h3>
        <p>All rocks on Earth change, but these changes usually happen very slowly. Some changes happen below Earths surface. Some changes happen above ground. These changes are all part of the rock cycle. The rock cycle describes each of the main types of rocks, how they form and how they change. Figure 4.1 shows how the three main rock types are related to each other. The arrows within the circle show how one type of rock may change to rock of another type. For example, igneous rock may break down into small pieces of sediment and become sedimentary rock. Igneous rock may be buried within the Earth and become metamorphic rock. Igneous rock may also change back to molten material and re-cool into a new igneous rock. Rocks are made of minerals. The minerals may be so tiny that you can only see them with a microscope. The minerals may be really large. A rock may be made of only one type of mineral. More often rocks are made of a mixture of different minerals. Rocks are named for the combinations of minerals they are made of and the ways those minerals came together. Remember that different minerals form under different environmental conditions. So the minerals in a rock contain clues about the conditions in which the rock formed (Figure 4.2). </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Three Main Categories of Rocks</h3>
        <p>Geologists group rocks based on how they were formed. The three main kinds of rocks are: 1. Igneous rocks form when magma cools below Earths surface or lava cools at the surface (Figure 4.3). 2. Sedimentary rocks form when sediments are compacted and cemented together (Figure 4.4). These sediments may be gravel, sand, silt or clay. Sedimentary rocks often have pieces of other rocks in them. Some sedimentary rocks form the solid minerals left behind after a liquid evaporates. 3. Metamorphic rocks form when an existing rock is changed by heat or pressure. The minerals in the rock change but do not melt (Figure 4.5). The rock experiences these changes within the Earth. Rocks can be changed from one type to another, and the rock cycle describes how this happens. </p>

        <h3>Processes of the Rock Cycle</h3>
        <p>Any type of rock can change and become a new type of rock. Magma can cool and crystallize. Existing rocks can be weathered and eroded to form sediments. Rock can change by heat or pressure deep in Earths crust. There are three main processes that can change rock: Cooling and forming crystals. Deep within the Earth, temperatures can get hot enough to melt rock. This molten material is called magma. As it cools, crystals grow, forming an igneous rock. The crystals will grow larger if the magma cools slowly, as it does if it remains deep within the Earth. If the magma cools quickly, the crystals will be very small. Weathering and erosion. Water, wind, ice, and even plants and animals all act to wear down rocks. Over time they can break larger rocks into smaller pieces called sediments. Moving water, wind, and glaciers then carry these pieces from one place to another. The sediments are eventually dropped, or deposited, somewhere. The sediments may then be compacted and cemented together. This forms a sedimentary rock. This whole process can take hundreds or thousands of years. Metamorphism. This long word means to change form. A rock undergoes metamorphism if it is exposed to extreme heat and pressure within the crust. With metamorphism, the rock does not melt all the way. The rock changes due to heat and pressure. A metamorphic rock may have a new mineral composition and/or texture. An interactive rock cycle diagram can be found here:  The rock cycle really has no beginning or end. It just continues. The processes involved in the rock cycle take place over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years. Even though for us rocks are solid and unchanging, they slowly change all the time. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>There are three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Melting and later cooling, erosion and sedimentation, and metamorphism transform one type of rock into another type of rock or change sediments into rock. The rock cycle describes the transformations of one type of rock to another. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows types of rocks and rock formation cycles. There are three major rock types. Rock of these three rock types can become rock of one of the other rock types. All rocks on Earth change, but these changes usually happen very slowly. Some changes happen below Earths surface. Some changes happen above ground. Any type of rock can change and become a new type of rock. Magma can cool and crystallize. Existing rocks can be weathered and eroded to form sediments.

        <p>This diagram shows how rocks can change from one type to another when they undergo certain processes. For magma, when it solidifies, it becomes an igneous rock. Igneous rocks can then turn into metamorphic rocks when they undergo metamorphism. They can also turn back into magma when they undergo melting. Otherwise, when igneous rocks go through erosion, they become sediment. Sediment can also be obtained from metamorphic and sedimentary rocks when they undergo erosion, too. Sediments can then undergo lithification to become sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks can also become metamorphic rocks when they undergo metamorphism. And finally, metamorphic rocks can turn into magma when they undergo melting.</p>

        <p>The Rock Cycle illustrates how rocks continually change form. There are three basic types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic, and each of these rocks can be changed into any one of the other types. The names of the rock types refer to the way the rocks are formed. Arrows in the diagram display how one type of rock may change to another type of rock. All igneous rocks start out as melted rock(magma) and then crystallize, or freeze. When an igneous rock is exposed on the surface, it goes through the process of weathering and erosion that breaks the rock down into smaller pieces. Wind and water carry the smaller pieces of igneous rock into piles called sediment. Through the process of compaction and cementation, the sediment gets buried and the pieces of rock become cemented together to form a new type of rock called a sedimentary rock. If a sedimentary rock is exposed at the surface, it can be eroded away and eventually changed into a new sedimentary rock. However, if a sedimentary(or an igneous) rock gets buried deep in the Earth, heat and pressure will cause profound physical and/or chemical change. This process is called metamorphosis, and the new rock is called a metamorphic rock. Metamorphic rock can also be weathered and eroded and eventually changed into a sedimentary rock. Or, if a metamorphic rock is forced deeper into the Earth, the rock can melt and become magma. Igneous rock and sedimentary rock can also be forced deep into the Earth and melt into magma. Once magma cools, it forms igneous rocks again.</p>
