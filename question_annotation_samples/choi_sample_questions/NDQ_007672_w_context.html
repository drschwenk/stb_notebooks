        <h3>Why Your Body Needs Food</h3>
        <p>Your body needs food for three purposes: 1. Food gives the body energy. You need energy for everything you do. The energy in food is measured in a unit called the Calorie. 2. Food provides building materials for the body. The body needs building materials for growth and repair. 3. Food contains substances that help control body processes. Body processes must be kept in balance for good health. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>What Are Nutrients</h3>
        <p>There are a variety of substances in foods that the body needs. Any substance in food that the body needs is called a nutrient. There are six major types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, minerals, and vitamins. Carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids can be used for energy. Proteins also provide building materials. Proteins, minerals, and vitamins help control body processes. Water is needed by all cells just to stay alive. The six types of nutrients can be divided into two major categories based on how much of them the body needs. The categories are macronutrients and micronutrients. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
        <p>Macronutrients are nutrients the body needs in relatively large amounts. They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>Carbohydrates include sugars, starches, and fiber. Sugars and starches are used by the body for energy. One gram of sugar or starch provides 4 Calories of energy. Fiber doesnt provide energy, but it is needed for other uses. At age 13 years, you need about 130 grams of carbohydrates a day. Figure 17.2 shows good food sources of each type. Sugars are small, simple carbohydrates. They are found in foods such as milk and fruit. Sugars in foods such as these are broken down by your digestive system to glucose, the simplest of all sugars. Glucose is taken up by cells for energy. Starches are larger, complex carbohydrates. They are found in foods such as grains and vegetables. Starches are broken down by your digestive system to glucose, which is used for energy. Fiber is a complex carbohydrate that consists mainly of cellulose and comes only from plants. High-fiber foods include whole grains and legumes such as beans. Fiber cant be broken down by the digestive system, but it plays important roles in the body. It helps keep sugar and lipids at normal levels in the blood. It also helps keep food waste moist so it can pass easily out of the body. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Proteins</h3>
        <p>Proteins are nutrients made up of smaller molecules called amino acids. The digestive system breaks down proteins in food to amino acids, which are used for protein synthesis. Proteins synthesized from the amino acids in food serve many vital functions. They make up muscles, control body processes, fight infections, and carry substances in the blood. If you eat more protein than you need for these functions, the extra protein is used for energy. One gram of protein provides 4 Calories of energy, the same as carbohydrates. A 13-year-old needs to eat about 34 grams of protein a day. Figure 17.3 shows good food sources of protein. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lipids</h3>
        <p>Lipids are nutrients such as fats. They are used for energy and other important purposes. One gram of lipids provides the body with 9 Calories of energy, more than twice as much as carbohydrates or proteins. Lipids also make up cell membranes, protect nerves, control blood pressure, and help blood clot. You must consume some lipids for these purposes. Good food sources of lipids are shown in Figure 17.4. Any extra lipids you consume are stored as fat. A certain amount of stored fat is needed to cushion and protect internal organs and insulate the body. However, too much stored fat can lead to obesity and cause significant health problems. A type of lipid called trans fat is found in many processed foods. Trans fat is rare in nature but is manufactured and added to foods to preserve freshness. Eating foods that contain trans fat increases the risk of heart disease. Trans fat may be found in such foods as cookies, doughnuts, crackers, fried foods, ground beef, and margarine. </p>

        <h3>Water</h3>
        <p>Water is essential to life because chemical reactions within cells take place in water. Most people can survive only a few days without consuming water to replace their water losses. How do you lose water? You lose water in your breath each time you exhale. You lose water in urine. You lose water in sweat, especially if you are active in warm weather. The boy in Figure 17.5 is taking a water break while playing outside on a hot day. If he doesnt take in enough water to replace the water lost in sweat, he may become dehydrated. Symptoms of dehydration include dry mouth, headache, and dizziness. Dehydration can be very serious. It can even cause death. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Micronutrients</h3>
        <p>Micronutrients are nutrients the body needs in relatively small amounts. They include minerals and vitamins. These nutrients dont provide the body with energy, but they are still essential for good health. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Minerals</h3>
        <p>Minerals are chemical elements that dont come from living things or include the element carbon. Many minerals are needed in the diet for normal functioning of the body. Several minerals that are needed in relatively large amounts are listed in Table 17.1. As you can see from these examples, minerals have a diversity of important functions. Your body cant produce any of the minerals it needs, so you must get them from the food you eat. The table shows good food sources of the minerals. Mineral Calcium Chloride Magnesium Phosphorus Potassium Sodium Function strong bones and teeth salt-water balance strong bones strong bones and teeth muscle and nerve functions muscle and nerve functions Good Food Sources milk, green leafy vegetables table salt, most packaged foods whole grains, nuts poultry, whole grains meat, bananas table salt, most packaged foods Not getting enough minerals can cause health problems. For example, not getting enough calcium may cause osteoporosis. This is a disease in which the bones become porous so they break easily. Getting too much of some minerals can also cause health problems. Many people get too much sodium. Sodium is added to most packaged foods. People often add more sodium to their food by using table salt. Too much sodium has been linked to high blood pressure in some people. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Vitamins</h3>
        <p>The vitamins to watch out for are A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are stored by the body, so they can build up to high levels. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. An apple contains about 20 grams of carbohydrates. How much energy does it provide? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>List three reasons why your body needs food.
Define nutrient, and identify the six major types of nutrients.
Describe macronutrients, their functions, and foods that contain them.
Describe micronutrients, their functions, and foods that contain them.
</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Your body needs food for energy, building materials, and substances that control body processes. Nutrients are substances in food that your body needs. There are six types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, water, minerals, and vitamins. Macronutrients are nutrients that are needed in relatively large amounts. They include carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and water. Except for water, macronutrients can all provide the body with energy. Micronutrients are nutrients that are needed in relatively small amounts. They include minerals and vitamins. They do not provide the body with energy but are needed for good health. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>5. Compare and contrast macronutrients and micronutrients. 6. Explain why you need fiber in your diet even though you cant digest it. 7. Why is water considered a nutrient? </p>
