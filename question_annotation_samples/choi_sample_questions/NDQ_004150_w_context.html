        <h3>Distribution of Water</h3>
        <p>Earths oceans contain 97% of the planets water. That leaves just 3% as fresh water, water with low concentrations of salts (Figure 1.1). Most fresh water is trapped as ice in the vast glaciers and ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. How is the 3% of fresh water divided into different reservoirs? How much of that water is useful for living creatures? How much for people? A storage location for water such as an ocean, glacier, pond, or even the atmosphere is known as a reservoir. A water molecule may pass through a reservoir very quickly or may remain for much longer. The amount of time a molecule stays in a reservoir is known as its residence time.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Of Earths water, 97% is in the oceans. Of the remaining 3%, much is trapped in ice and glaciers. A substance is stored in a reservoir and the amount of time it stays in that reservoir is its residence time. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. If Earth is the water planet, why is water sometimes a scarce resource? 2. What are the reservoirs for water? 3. In which reservoirs does water have the longest residence times? The shortest? </p>
