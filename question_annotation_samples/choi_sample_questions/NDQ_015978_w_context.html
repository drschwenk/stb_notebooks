        <h3>What Are Hydrocarbons</h3>
        <p>Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons are the simplest type of carbon-based compounds. Nonetheless, they can vary greatly in size. The smallest hydrocarbons have just one or two carbon atoms, but large hydrocarbons may have hundreds. The size of hydrocarbon molecules influences their properties. For example, it influences their boiling and melting points. As a result, some hydrocarbons are gases at room temperature, while others are liquids or solids. Hydrocarbons are generally nonpolar and do not dissolve in water. In fact, they tend to repel water. Thats why they are used in floor wax and similar products. Hydrocarbons can be classified in two basic classes. The classes are saturated hydrocarbons and unsaturated hydrocarbons. This classification is based on the number of bonds between carbon atoms. You can learn more about both types of hydrocarbons at this URL:  (6:41). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Saturated Hydrocarbons</h3>
        <p>Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are the simplest hydrocarbons. They are called saturated because each carbon atom is bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogen. You can see an example of a saturated hydrocarbon in Figure Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. The name of specific alkanes always ends in -ane. The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table 9.2. The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. This table shows only alkanes with relatively few carbon atoms. Some alkanes have many more carbon atoms. What properties might larger alkanes have? For example, do you think that any of them might be solids?

        <h3>Shapes of Alkanes</h3>
        <p>Structural formulas are often used to represent hydrocarbon compounds because the molecules can have different shapes, or structures. Hydrocarbons may form straight chains, branched chains, or rings. Figure 9.8 shows an example of an alkane with each shape. In straight-chain molecules, all the carbon atoms are lined up in a row like cars of a train. They form what is called the backbone of the molecule. In branched-chain molecules, at least one of the carbon atoms branches off to the side from the backbone. In cyclic molecules, the chain of carbon atoms is joined at the two ends to form a ring. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Isomers</h3>
        <p>Even compounds with the same number of carbon and hydrogen atoms can have different shapes. These compounds are called isomers. Look at the examples in Figure 9.9. The figure shows the structural formulas of butane and its isomer iso-butane. Both molecules have four carbon atoms and ten hydrogen atoms (C4 H10 ), but the atoms are arranged differently. Butane is a straight-chain molecule. Iso-butane is branched. You can see three-dimensional models of these two isomers at the URLs below. You can rotate the molecule models to get a better idea of their shapes. </p>

        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 9.9 Butane and isobutane have the same atoms but different shapes. Isomers usually have somewhat different properties. For example, straight-chain molecules generally have higher boiling and melting points than their branched-chain isomers. The boiling and melting points of iso-butane are -12C and -160C, respectively. Compare these values with the boiling and melting points of butane in Table 9.2. Do these two compounds follow the general trend?</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cycloalkanes</h3>
        <p>Ring-shaped alkanes are called cycloalkanes. They usually contain just five or six carbon atoms because larger rings are not very stable. However, rings can join together to create larger molecules consisting of two or more rings. Compared with the straight- and branched-chain alkanes, cycloalkanes have higher boiling and melting points. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Unsaturated Hydrocarbons</h3>
        <p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms. As a result, the carbon atoms are unable to bond with as many hydrogen atoms as they would if they were joined only by single bonds. This makes them unsaturated with hydrogen. Unsaturated hydrocarbons are classified on the basis of their bonds as alkenes, alkynes, or aromatic hydrocarbons. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Alkenes</h3>
        <p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one double bond are called alkenes. The name of a specific alkene always ends in ene, with a prefix indicating the number of carbon atoms. Figure 9.10 shows the structural formula for the smallest alkene. It has just two carbon atoms and is named ethene. Ethene is produced by most fruits and vegetables. It speeds up ripening and also rotting. Figure 9.11 shows the effects of ethene on bananas. Like alkanes, alkenes can have different shapes. They can form straight chains, branched chains, or rings. Alkenes can also form isomers, or compounds with the same atoms but different shapes. Generally, the physical properties of alkenes are similar to those of alkanes. Smaller alkenes, such as ethene, have relatively high boiling and melting points. They are gases at room temperature. Larger alkenes have lower boiling and melting points. They are liquids or waxy solids at room temperature. </p>

        <h3>Alkynes</h3>
        <p>Unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one triple bond are called alkynes. The name of specific alkynes always end in yne, with a prefix for the number of carbon atoms. Figure 9.12 shows the smallest alkyne, called ethyne, which has just two carbon atoms. Ethyne is also called acetylene. It is burned in acetylene torches, like the one in Figure 9.13. Acetylene produces so much heat when it burns that it can melt metal. Breaking all those bonds between carbon atoms releases a lot of energy. Alkynes may form straight or branched chains. They rarely occur as cycloalkynes. In fact, alkynes of all shapes are relatively rare, at least in nature. </p>

        <h3>Aromatic Hydrocarbons</h3>
        <p>Unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons are called aromatic hydrocarbons. Thats because they have a strong aroma, or scent. Their molecules consist of six carbon atoms in a ring shape, connected by alternating single and double bonds. Aromatic hydrocarbons may have a single ring or multiple rings joined together by bonds between their carbon atoms. Benzene is the smallest aromatic hydrocarbon. It has just one ring. You can see its structural formula in Figure 9.14. Benzene has many uses. For example, it is used in air fresheners and mothballs because of its strong scent.

        <h3>Uses and Sources of Hydrocarbons</h3>
        <p>It is hard to overstate the importance of hydrocarbons to modern life. Hydrocarbons have even been called the driving force of western civilization. You saw some ways they are used in Figure 9.6. Several other ways are illustrated in Figure 9.15. Their most important use is as fuels. Gasoline, natural gas, fuel oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, coal, kerosene, and propane are just some of the hydrocarbon compounds that are burned for fuel. Hydrocarbons are also used to manufacture many products, including plastics and synthetic fabrics such as polyester. The main source of hydrocarbons is fossil fuels coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Fossil fuels form over hundreds of millions of years when dead organisms are covered with sediments and put under great pressure. Giant ferns in ancient swamps turned into coal deposits. Dead organisms in ancient seas gradually formed deposits of petroleum and natural gas. You can read more about these sources of hydrocarbons in the chapter Introduction to Energy and at the URL below. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen. They are the simplest type of carbon- based compounds. Saturated hydrocarbons contain only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are also called alkanes. They may form straight-chain, branched-chain, or cyclic molecules. Compounds with the same number of atoms but different shapes are called isomers. Unsaturated hydrocarbons contain at least one double or triple bond between carbon atoms. Hydrocarbons with double bonds are called alkenes. Those with triple bonds are called alkynes. Aromatic hydrocarbons consist of six carbon atoms in a ring shape, connected by alternating single and double bonds. Hydrocarbons are extremely important to modern life.
