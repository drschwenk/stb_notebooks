        <h3>Sexually Transmitted Infections</h3>
        <p>A sexually transmitted infection (STI) is a disease that spreads mainly through sexual contact. STIs are caused by pathogens that enter the body through the reproductive organs. Many STIs also spread through body fluids such as blood. For example, a shared tattoo needle is one way that some STIs can spread. Some STIs can also spread from a mother to her infant during birth. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>STI Myths and Facts</h3>
        <p>STIs are more common in teens and young adults than in older people. One reason is that young people are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. They also may not know how STIs spread. Instead, they may believe myths about STIs, like those in Table 22.1. Knowing the facts is important to prevent the spread of STIs. Myth If you are sexually active with just one person, then you cant get STIs. If you dont have any symptoms, then you dont have an STI. Getting STIs is no big deal, because they can be cured with medicines. Fact The only sure way to avoid getting STIs is to practice abstinence from sexual activity. Many STIs do not cause symptoms, especially in fe- males. Only some STIs can be cured with medicines; others cannot be cured. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Bacterial STIs</h3>
        <p>A number of STIs are caused by bacteria. Bacterial STIs can usually be cured with antibiotics. However, some people with bacterial STIs may not have symptoms so they fail to get treatment. Left untreated, these infections may damage reproductive organs and lead to an inability to have children. Three bacterial STIs are chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the U.S. Females are more likely to develop it than males. Symptoms may include burning during urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Gonorrhea is another common bacterial STI. Symptoms may include painful urination and a discharge from the vagina or penis. Syphilis is a very serious STI but somewhat less common than chlamydia or gonorrhea. It usually begins with a small sore on the genitals. This is followed a few months later by a rash and flu-like symptoms. If syphilis isnt treated, it can eventually damage the heart, brain, and other organs and even cause death. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Viral STIs</h3>
        <p>Several STIs are caused by viruses. Viral STIs cant be cured with antibiotics. Other drugs may help control the symptoms of viral STIs, but the infections usually last for life. Three viral STIs are genital warts, genital herpes, and AIDS. Genital herpes is a common STI caused by a herpes virus. The virus causes painful blisters on the penis or near the vaginal opening. The blisters generally go away on their own, but they may return repeatedly throughout life. There is no cure for genital herpes, but medicines can help prevent or shorten outbreaks. Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV destroys lymphocytes that normally fight infections. AIDS develops if the number of lymphocytes drops to a very low level. People with AIDS come down with diseasessuch as certain rare cancersthat almost never occur in people with a healthy immune system. Medicines can delay the progression of an HIV infection and may prevent AIDS from developing. Genital warts is an STI caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), which is pictured in Figure 22.15. This is one of the most common STIs in U.S. teens. Genital warts cant be cured, but a vaccine can prevent most HPV infections. The vaccine is recommended for boys and girls starting at 11 or 12 years of age. Its important to prevent HPV infections because they may lead to cancer later in life. </p>

        <h3>Other Disorders of the Reproductive System</h3>
        <p>Other reproductive system disorders include injuries and noninfectious diseases. These are different in males and females. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Male Reproductive System Disorders</h3>
        <p>Most common disorders of the male reproductive system involve the testes. They include injuries and cancer. Injuries to the testes are very common. In teens, such injuries occur most often while playing sports. Injuries to the testes are likely to be very painful and cause bruising and swelling. However, they generally subside fairly quickly. Cancer of the testes is most common in males aged 15 to 35. It occurs when cells in the testes grow out of control and form a tumor. If found early, cancer of the testes usually can be cured with surgery. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Female Reproductive System Disorders</h3>
        <p>Disorders of the female reproductive system may involve the vagina, uterus, or ovaries. They may also affect the breasts. Vaginitis is a very common disorder. Symptoms include redness and itching of the vagina. It may be caused by soap or bubble bath. Another possible cause is a yeast infection. Yeast normally grow in the vagina. If they multiple too quickly, they may cause irritation. A yeast infection can be treated with medication. Cysts may develop in the ovaries. A cyst is a sac filled with fluid or other material. Ovarian cysts are usually harmless and often disappear on their own. However, some cysts may be painful and require surgery. Many females experience abdominal cramps during menstruation. This is usually normal and not a cause for concern. Exercise, heat, or medication may help relieve the pain. In severe cases, prescription medicine may be needed. Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in females. It occurs when cells in the breast grow out of control and form a tumor. Breast cancer is rare in teens but becomes more common as females get older. Regular screening is recommended for most women starting around age 40. If found early, breast cancer usually can be cured with surgery. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Your Reproductive System Healthy</h3>
        <p>Maintaining overall good health will help keep your reproductive system healthy. You should eat right, get regular exercise, and follow other healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, the following practices will help keep the reproductive system healthy: Keep the genitals clean. A daily shower or bath is all thats needed. Avoid harsh soaps or other personal hygiene products that may be irritating. Avoid risky behaviors. This includes contact with blood or dirty needles as well as sexual activity. If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every 4 to 6 hours. This will reduce your risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a very dangerous condition that may occur if tampons are left in too long. If you are a boy, wear a protective cup if you play a contact sport. This will help protect the testes from injury. You should also learn how to check yourself for testicular cancer (see Figure 22.16). You can learn how by watching this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Reproduction is important not only to families but also to planet Earth. Human reproduction has led to rapid growth of the human population. 1. How big is the human population? 2. Do you think that Earth is overpopulated when it comes to human beings? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A healthy reproductive system is important for two reasons. Its important for overall good health. Its also important for reproduction. If the reproductive system isnt healthy, a person may be unable to have children. Many health problems can affect the reproductive system. They include sexually transmitted infections and cancers. The good news is that many reproductive health problems can be prevented or cured. </p>
