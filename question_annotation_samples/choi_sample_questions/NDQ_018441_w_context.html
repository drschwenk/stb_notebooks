        <h3>What Is a Solenoid</h3>
        <p>A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. You can see a solenoid in the Figure 1.1. Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How is a solenoid like a bar magnet? A: Like a bar magnet, a solenoid has north and south magnetic poles and is surrounded by a magnetic field. </p>

        <h3>Strength of a Solenoid</h3>
        <p>Any wire with current flowing through it has a magnetic field. However, the magnetic field around a coiled wire is stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire. Thats because each turn of the wire in the coil has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns to the coil of wire increases the strength of the field. Increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil also increases the strength of the magnetic field. </p>

        <h3>Uses of Solenoids</h3>
        <p>A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into motion. Solenoids are often used in devices that need a sudden burst of power to move a specific part. In addition to paintball markers, you can find solenoids in machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric dishwashers. Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the Figure 1.2. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. Using more turns of wire in the coil or more current increases the strength of the solenoids magnetic field. A solenoid converts electromagnetic energy into motion, providing a burst of power that can move a specific part of a device. </p>
