        <h3>Elements</h3>
        <p>An element is a pure substance. It cannot be separated into any other substances. There are more than 90 different elements that occur in nature. Some are much more common than others. Hydrogen is the most common element in the universe. Oxygen is the most common element in Earths crust. Figure 3.7 shows other examples of elements. Still others are described in the video below.

        <h3>Properties of Elements</h3>
        <p>Each element has a unique set of properties that make it different from all other elements. As a result, elements can be identified by their properties. For example, the elements iron and nickel are both metals that are good conductors of heat and electricity. However, iron is attracted by a magnet, whereas nickel is not. How could you use this property to separate iron objects from nickel objects? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>History of Elements</h3>
        <p>The idea of elements is not new. It dates back about 2500 years to ancient Greece. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle thought that all matter consists of just four elements. He identified the elements as earth, air, water, and fire. He thought that different kinds of matter contain only these four elements but in different combinations. Aristotles ideas about elements were accepted for the next 2000 years. Then, scientists started discovering the many unique substances we call elements today. You can read when and how each of the elements was discovered at the link below. Scientists soon realized that there are far more than just four elements. Eventually, they discovered a total of 92 naturally occurring elements. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Elements and Atoms</h3>
        <p>The smallest particle of an element that still has the elements properties is an atom. All the atoms of an element are alike, and they are different from the atoms of all other elements. For example, atoms of gold are the same whether they are found in a gold nugget or a gold ring (see Figure 3.8). All gold atoms have the same structure and properties. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Compounds</h3>
        <p>There are millions of different substances in the world. Thats because elements can combine in many different ways to form new substances. In fact, most elements are found in compounds. A compound is a unique substance that forms when two or more elements combine chemically. An example is water, which forms when hydrogen and oxygen combine chemically. A compound always has the same components in the same proportions. It also has the same composition throughout. You can learn more about compounds and how they form by watching this video: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Properties of Compounds</h3>
        <p>A compound has different properties than the substances it contains. For example, hydrogen and oxygen are gases at room temperature. But when they combine chemically, they form liquid water. Another example is table salt, or sodium chloride. It contains sodium and chlorine. Sodium is a silvery solid that reacts explosively with water, and chlorine is a poisonous gas (see Figure 3.9). But together, sodium and chlorine form a harmless, unreactive compound that you can safely sprinkle on food. </p>

        <h3>Molecules and Crystals</h3>
        <p>The smallest particle of a compound that still has the compounds properties is a molecule. A molecule consists of two or more atoms that are joined together. For example, a molecule of water consists of two hydrogen atoms joined to one oxygen atom (see Figure 3.10). You can learn more about molecules at this link:  Some compounds form crystals instead of molecules. A crystal is a rigid, lattice-like framework of many atoms bonded together. Table salt is an example of a compound that forms crystals (see Figure 3.11). Its crystals are made up of many sodium and chloride ions. Ions are electrically charged forms of atoms. You can actually watch crystals forming in this video:  . </p>

        <h3>Mixtures</h3>
        <p>Not all combined substances are compounds. Some are mixtures. A mixture is a combination of two or more substances in any proportion. The substances in a mixture may be elements or compounds. The substances dont combine chemically to form a new substance, as they do in a compound. Instead, they keep their original properties and just intermix. Examples of mixtures include salt and water in the ocean and gases in the atmosphere. Other examples are pictured in Figure 3.12. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Mixtures</h3>
        <p>Some mixtures are homogeneous. This means they have the same composition throughout. An example is salt water in the ocean. Ocean water everywhere is about 3.5 percent salt. Some mixtures are heterogeneous. This means they vary in their composition. An example is trail mix. No two samples of trail mix, even from the same package, are likely to be exactly the same. One sample might have more raisins, another might have more nuts. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Particle Size in Mixtures</h3>
        <p>Mixtures have different properties depending on the size of their particles. Three types of mixtures based on particle size are described below. Figure 3.13 shows examples of each type. You can watch videos about the three types of mixtures at these links: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A solution is a homogeneous mixture with tiny particles. An example is salt water. The particles of a solution are too small to reflect light. As a result, you cannot see them. Thats why salt water looks the same as pure water. The particles of solutions are also too small to settle or be filtered out of the mixture. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture with large particles. An example is muddy water. The particles of a suspension are big enough to reflect light, so you can see them. They are also big enough to settle or be filtered out. Anything that you have to shake before using, such as salad dressing, is usually a suspension. A colloid is a homogeneous mixture with medium-sized particles. Examples include homogenized milk and gelatin. The particles of a colloid are large enough to reflect light, so you can see them. But they are too small to settle or filter out of the mixture. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Separating Mixtures</h3>
        <p>The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine. Therefore, they usually can be easily separated again. Their different physical properties are used to separate them. For example, oil is less dense than water, so a mixture of oil and water can be separated by letting it stand until the oil floats to the top. Other ways of separating mixtures are shown in Figure 3.14 and in the videos below.  (2:30) MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. How could you use water and a coffee filter to separate a mixture of salt and sand? 6. Homogenized milk is a colloid. It has been treated to prevent its different components from separating when it stands. When non-homogenized milk stands, the cream rises to the top because it is less dense than the rest of the milk. Which type of mixture is non-homogenized milk? Explain your answer. </p>
