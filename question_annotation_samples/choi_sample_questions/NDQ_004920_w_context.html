        <h3>Oceans Moderate Climate</h3>
        <p>The oceans, along with the atmosphere, keep temperatures fairly constant worldwide. While some places on Earth get as cold as -70o C and others as hot as 55o C, the range is only 125o C. On Mercury temperatures go from -180o C to 430o C, a range of 610o C. The oceans, along with the atmosphere, distribute heat around the planet. The oceans absorb heat near the Equator and then move that solar energy to more polar regions. The oceans also moderate climate within a region. At the same latitude, the temperature range is smaller in lands nearer the oceans than away from the oceans. Summer temperatures are not as hot, and winter temperatures are not as cold, because water takes a long time to heat up or cool down. </p>

        <h3>Water Cycle</h3>
        <p>The oceans are an essential part of Earths water cycle. Since they cover so much of the planet, most evaporation comes from oceans and most precipitation falls on oceans. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Biologically Rich</h3>
        <p>The oceans are home to an enormous amount of life. That is, they have tremendous biodiversity (Figure 1.1). Tiny ocean plants, called phytoplankton, create the base of a food web that supports all sorts of life forms. Marine life makes up the majority of all biomass on Earth. (Biomass is the total mass of living organisms in a given area.) These organisms supply us with food and even the oxygen created by marine plants. Polar bears are well adapted to frigid Arc- tic waters. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Oceans moderate Earths temperature by not changing temperature rapidly and by distributing heat around the planet. Oceans are an enormous reservoir for water in the water cycle. Oceans have tremendous biodiversity and the majority of all biomass on Earth. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. What organisms form the base of the ocean food web? 2. How do the oceans moderate Earths temperature? 3. What role do oceans play in the water cycle? </p>
