        <h3>How Populations Grow</h3>
        <p>A population usually grows when it has what it needs. If theres plenty of food and other resources, the population will get bigger. Look at Table 18.1. It shows how a population of bacteria grew. A single bacteria cell was added to a container of nutrients. Conditions were ideal. The bacteria divided every 30 minutes. After just 10 hours, there were more than a million bacteria! Assume the bacteria population keeps growing at this rate. How many bacteria will there be at 10.5 hours? Or at 12 hours? Time (hours) 0 0.5 Number of Bacteria 1 2 Time (hours) 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 5.5 6.0 6.5 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.5 9.0 9.5 10 Number of Bacteria 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1,024 2,048 4,096 8,192 16,384 32,768 65,536 131,072 262,144 524,288 1,048,576 </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Population Growth Rate</h3>
        <p>The population growth rate is how fast a population is growing. The letter r stands for the growth rate. The growth rate equals the number of new members added to the population in a year for each 100 members already in the population. The growth rate includes new members added to the population and old members removed from the population. Births add new members to the population. Deaths remove members from the population. The formula for population growth rate is: r = b - d, where b = birth rate (number of births in 1 year per 100 population members) d = death rate (number of deaths in 1 year per 100 population members) If the birth rate is greater than the death rate, r is positive. This means that the population is growing bigger. For example, if b = 10 and d = 8, r = 2. This means that the population is growing by 2 individuals per year for every 100 members of the population. This may not sound like much, but its a fairly high rate of growth. A population growing at this rate would double in size in just 35 years! If the birth rate is less than the death rate, r is negative. This means that the population is becoming smaller. What do you think might cause this to happen? </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Carrying Capacity</h3>
        <p>A population cant keep growing bigger and bigger forever. Sooner or later, it will run out of things it needs. For a given species, there is a maximum population that can be supported by the environment. This maximum is called the carrying capacity. When a population gets close to the carrying capacity, it usually grows more slowly. You can see this in Figure 18.16. When the population reaches the carrying capacity, it stops growing. </p>

        <h3>Human Population Growth</h3>
        <p>Figure 18.17 shows how the human population has grown. It grew very slowly for tens of thousands of years. Then, in the 1800s, something happened to change all that. The human population started to grow much faster. </p>

        <h3>The Demographic Transition</h3>
        <p>The industrial revolution is what happened. The industrial revolution began in the late 1700s in Europe, North America, and a few other places. In these places, the human population grew faster. While there had always been a lot of births, the population grew because the death rate fell. It fell for several reasons: 1. New farm machines were invented. They increased the amount of food that could be produced. With more food, people were healthier and could live longer. 2. Steam engines and railroads were built. These machines could quickly carry food long distances. This made food shortages less likely. 3. Sanitation was improved. Sewers were dug to carry away human wastes (see Figure 18.18). This helped reduce the spread of disease. With better food and less chance of disease, the death rate fell. More children lived long enough to reach adulthood and have children of their own. As the death rate fell, the birth rate stayed high for a while. This caused rapid population growth. However, the birth rate in these countries has since fallen to a rate close to that of the low death rate. The result was slow population growth once again. These changes are called the demographic transition. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Recent Population Growth</h3>
        <p>More recently, the death rate has fallen because of the availability of more food and medical advances: A green revolution began in the mid 1900s. New methods and products increased how much food could be grown. For example, chemicals were developed that killed weeds without harming crops. Pesticides were developed that killed pests that destroyed crops. Vaccinations were developed that could prevent many diseases (see Figure 18.19). Antibiotics were discov- ered that could cure most infections caused by bacteria. Together, these two advances saved countless lives. Today in many countries, death rates have gone down but birth rates remain high. This means that the population is growing. Figure 18.20 shows the growth rates of human populations all over the world. </p>

        <h3>Future Population Growth</h3>
        <p>The growth of the human population has started to slow down. You can see this in Figure 18.21. It may stop growing by the mid 2000s. Scientists think that the human population will peak at about 9 billion people. What will need to change for the population to stop growing then? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Human Population and the Environment</h3>
        <p>Are 9 billion people the human carrying capacity? It looks that way in Figure 18.21. But some people think there are too many of us already. Thats because we are harming the environment. Supplying all those people with energy creates a lot of pollution. For example, huge oil spills have killed millions of living things. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. This also increases causes global warming. Fossil fuels and other resources are being used up. We may run out of oil by the mid 2000s. Many other resources will run out sooner or later. People are killing too many animals for food. For example, some of the best fishing grounds in the oceans have almost no fish left. People have destroyed many habitats. For example, theyve drained millions of acres of wetlands. Wetlands have a great diversity of species. As wetlands shrink, species go extinct. People have allowed alien or invasive species - species originally from a different area - to invade new habitats. Often, the aliens have no natural enemies in their new home. They may drive native species extinct. Figure People themselves are also affected by the large size of the human population. A minority of people use most of the worlds energy and other resources. Many other people lack resources. Many dont have enough to eat or live with </p>

        <h3>Sustainable Development</h3>
        <p>Is it possible for all the worlds people to live well and still protect the planet? Thats the aim of sustainable development. Its goals are to: 1. Distribute resources fairly. 2. Conserve resources so they wont run out. 3. Use resources in ways that wont harm ecosystems. A smaller human population may be part of the solution. Better use of resources is another part. For example, when forests are logged, new trees should be planted. Everyone can help in the effort. What will you do? </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>6. Compare the three populations in the Table 18.2. Which one is growing fastest? Explain your answer. Population A B C Birth Rate (per 100 people) 14 16 18 Death rate (per 100 people) 3 6 8 7. Draw a graph of population growth for North America. It should show how the rate of growth changed during the demographic transition. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how populations grow.
Describe how the human population has grown.
State how the human population affects the environment.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Populations usually grow bigger when they have what they need. How fast they grow depends on birth and death rates. They grow more slowly as they get close to the carrying capacity. This is the biggest population the environment can support. Human population growth was slow until the 1800s. Both birth and death rates were high. Then, the death rate started to fall. In industrial countries, the birth rate soon fell as well. However, in many other places, the birth rate is still high. As a result, the human population is growing rapidly. It may reach 9 billion by the mid 2000s. The human population is already harming the environment. Many people dont get enough resources. They may lack shelter, food, or clean water. Sustainable development is needed. This means using resources in such a way that they wont run out and the planet wont be harmed. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this chapter, you read how humans are harming the environment. For example, we are quickly using up many natural resources. Soil is one of our most precious natural resources. It takes a very long time to form. But it can be washed away in a single rainstorm. How do you think human actions are affecting the soil? What can people do to protect this important resource? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Right now, there are almost 7 billion people in the world. As you read this sentence, at least three more people will be added. Think about that for second or so, and theres another three. You can actually watch the number of people increase, second by the second, at this link:  Why is the human population growing so fast? Has it always grown this fast? What causes populations to grow? In this lesson, youll find answers to all these questions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Define carrying capacity. 2. Describe how the human population grew up until the 1800s. 3. List two reasons the death rate fell in industrial countries in the 1800s. 4. What was the green revolution? When did happen? How did it affect the human population? 5. How is the human population harming the environment? </p>
