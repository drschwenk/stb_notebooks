        <h3>Basic Animal Traits</h3>
        <p>Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. All animals are heterotrophs. They eat other living things because they cant make their own food. All animals also have specialized cells that can do different jobs. Most animals have higher levels of organization as well. They may have specialized tissues, organs, and even organ systems. Having higher levels of organization allows animals to perform many complex functions.

        <h3>Specialized Cells</h3>
        <p>Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Unlike the cells of eukaryotes in the Plant and Fungus Kingdoms, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes. This in turn allows them to become specialized for particular jobs. The human nerve cell in Figure 11.2 is a good example of a specialized animal cell. Its shape suits it for its function of sending nerve signals to other cells. A nerve cell couldnt take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall. </p>

        <h3>What Animals Can Do</h3>
        <p>With their specialized cells and higher levels of organization, animals can do several things that other eukaryotes cannot. Animals can detect and quickly respond to a variety of stimuli. They have specialized nerve cells that can detect light, sound, touch, or other stimuli. Most animals also have a nervous system that can direct the body to respond to the stimuli. All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Specialized muscle and nerve tissues work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators and other dangers. Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Other heterotrophs, such as fungi, absorb nutrients directly from the environment.) </p>

        <h3>General Life Cycle of Animals</h3>
        <p>Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce haploid sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse. The diploid zygote that forms develops into an embryo. The embryo eventually develops into an adult, often going through one or more larval stages on the way. A larva (larvae, plural) is a distinct juvenile form that many animals go through before becoming an adult. The larval form may be very different from the adult form. For example, a caterpillar is the larval form of an insect that becomes a butterfly as an adult. </p>

        <h3>How Animals Are Classified</h3>
        <p>The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain. The Animal Kingdom, in turn, is divided into almost 40 phyla. Table 11.1 lists the 9 animal phyla that contain the largest numbers of species. Each phylum in the table has at least 10,000 species. Phylum Porifera Animals It Includes sponges Cnidaria jellyfish, corals Platyhelminthes flatworms, tapeworms, flukes Nematoda roundworms Mollusca snails, clams, squids Phylum Annelida Animals It Includes earthworms, leeches, marine worms Arthropoda insects, spiders, crustaceans, cen- tipedes Echinodermata sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, sea cucumbers Chordata tunicates, lancelets, fish, amphib- ians, reptiles, birds, mammals One basic way to divide animals is between invertebrates and vertebrates. Invertebrates are animals that lack a vertebral column, or backbone. All the phyla in Table 11.1, except the Phylum Chordata, consist only of invertebrates. Even the Phylum Chordata includes some invertebrate taxa. Invertebrates make up about 95 percent of all animal species. Vertebrates are animals that have a backbone. All of them are placed in the Phylum Chordata. Modern vertebrates include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Only about 5 percent of animal species are vertebrates. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Assume you must classify a mystery organism. What questions could you ask about the organism that would help you decide whether it is an animal? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. They are heterotrophic, meaning that they consume other organisms. Animals have specialized cells and often higher levels of organization. This allows them to do things that other eukaryotes cannot, such as move and digest food internally. Animals generally have a simple life cycle. The Animal Kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya Domain. The Animal Kingdom, in turn, is divided into almost 40 modern phyla. The Animal Kingdom can also be divided into two basic groups: invertebrates and vertebrates. Most animal species are invertebrates, which lack a backbone. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>There is great variation among species that are called animals. You can see some of the variation in Figure 11.1. Despite this variation, there are a number of traits that are shared by all animals. What traits do all animals share? Read on to find out. </p>
