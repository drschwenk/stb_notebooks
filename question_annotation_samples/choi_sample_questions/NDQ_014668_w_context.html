        <h3>Introduction to Electric Current</h3>
        <p>Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges. Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. When current flows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC). The current that flows through a battery-powered flashlight is direct current. When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC). The current that runs through the wires in your home is alternating current. Graphs of both types of current are shown in Figure 23.10. You can watch an animation of both types at this URL: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Explaining Electric Current</h3>
        <p>Why do charges flow in an electric current? The answer has to do with electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. An electric charge has potential energy because of its position in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where their potential energy is lower. This is similar to water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. In general, for an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. The difference in electric potential energy is called potential difference, or voltage. Voltage is measured in an SI unit called the volt (V). For example, the terminals of the car battery in Figure 23.11 have a potential difference of 12 volts. This difference in voltage results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current. </p>

        <h3>Sources of Voltage</h3>
        <p>Batteries like the one in Figure 23.11 are one of several possible sources of voltage needed to produce electric current. Sources of voltage include generators, chemical cells, and solar cells. Generators change the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine to electrical energy in a process called electromag- netic induction. You can read about generators and how they work in the chapter "Electromagnetism." Chemical and solar cells are devices that change chemical or light energy to electrical energy. You can read about both types of cells and how they work below. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Chemical Cells</h3>
        <p>Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. A chemical cell has two electrodes, which are strips made of different materials, such as zinc and carbon (see Figure 23.12). The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. Animations at the URL below show how batteries work. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. In the case of zinc and carbon electrodes, the zinc electrode attracts electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the carbon electrode gives up electrons and becomes positively charged. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. If wires are used to connect the two electrodes at their terminal ends, electric current will flow through the wires and can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Solar Cells</h3>
        <p>Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy. They contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy and gives off electrons. The electrons flow and create electric current. Figure 23.13 and the animation at the URL below show how a solar cell uses light energy to produce electric current and power a light bulb. Many calculators and other devices are also powered by solar cells. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 23.13 A solar cell is also called a photovoltaic (PV) cell because it uses light ("photo-") to produce voltage ("-voltaic"). The contacts in a PV cell are like the terminals in a chemical cell. One contact is negative and the other contact is positive, creating a difference in electric potential, or volt- age, which produces electric current.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Electric Current and Materials</h3>
        <p>Electric current cannot travel through empty space. It needs a material through which to travel. However, when current travels through a material, the flowing electrons collide with particles of the material, and this creates resistance. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Resistance</h3>
        <p>Resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges that occurs when electric current travels through matter. The SI unit of resistance is the ohm (named for the scientist Georg Ohm, whom you can read about below). Resistance is caused by electrons in a current bumping into electrons and ions in the matter through which the current is flowing. Resistance is similar to the friction that resists the movement of one surface as it slides over another. Resistance reduces the amount of current that can travel through the material because some of the electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb, the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge, and some of the electrical energy is converted to light and thermal energy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Electric Conductors and Insulators</h3>
        <p>Some materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials that have low resistance to electric current are called electric conductors. Many metalsincluding copper, aluminum, and steelare good conductors of electricity. Water that has even a tiny amount of impurities in it is an electric conductor as well. Materials that have high resistance to electric current are called electric insulators. Wood, rubber, and plastic are examples of electric insulators. Dry air is also an electric insulator. You probably know that electric wires are made of metal and coated with rubber or plastic (see Figure 23.14). Now you know why. Metals are good electric conductors, so they offer little resistance and allow most of the current to pass through. Rubber and plastic are good insulators, so they offer a lot of resistance and allow little current to pass through. When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. Thats why all the current passes through a metal wire and none flows through its rubber or plastic coating. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Properties that Affect Resistance</h3>
        <p>For a given material, three properties of the material determine how resistant it is to electric current: length, width, and temperature. Consider an electric wire like one of the wires in Figure 23.14. A longer wire has more resistance. Current must travel farther, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of wire. A wider wire has less resistance. A given amount of current has more room to flow through a wider wire. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Current is less likely to collide with slowly moving particles. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ohms Law</h3>
        <p>Voltage, or a difference in electric potential energy, is needed for electric current to flow. As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. Resistance, on the other hand, opposes the flow of electric current, so greater resistance results in less current. These relationships between current, voltage, and resistance were first demonstrated by a German scientist named Georg Ohm in the early 1800s, so they are referred to as Ohms law. Ohms law can be represented by the following equation. Current (amps) = Voltage (volts) Resistance (ohms) </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding Ohms Law</h3>
        <p>You may have a better understanding of Ohms law if you compare current flowing through a wire from a battery to water flowing through a garden hose from a tap. Increasing voltage is like opening the tap wider. When the tap is opened wider, more water flows through the hose. This is like an increase in current. Stepping on the hose makes it harder for the water to pass through. This is like increasing resistance, which causes less current to flow through a material.

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Ohms Law to Calculate Current</h3>
        <p>You can use the equation for current (above) to calculate the amount of current flowing through a material when voltage and resistance are known. Consider an electric wire that is connected to a 12-volt battery. If the wire has a resistance of 3 ohms, how much current is flowing through the wire? Current = 12 volts = 4 amps 3 ohms You Try It! Problem: A 120-volt voltage source is connected to a wire with 20 ohms of resistance. How much current flows through the wire? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>6. A 12-volt battery is connected to a light bulb by wires. The wires and light bulb together have 6 ohms of resistance. How many amps of current are flowing through the wires? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charge. It is measured in amperes (A). Direct current (DC) flows in just one direction. Alternating current (AC) keeps reversing direction. Electric current occurs whenever there is a difference in electric potential energy, or voltage. Voltage is measured in volts (V). Sources of voltage include electric generators and cells. Electric generators change kinetic energy to electrical energy. Chemical cells change chemical energy to electrical energy, and solar cells change solar energy to electrical energy. Electric current needs a material through which to travel, but particles of the material may resist the flow of current. Materials differ in how much they resist electric current. Materials with low resistance are called electric conductors, and materials with high resistance are called electric insulators. According to Ohms law, current increases when voltage increases or resistance decreases. Current can be calculated as voltage divided by resistance. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>When lightning discharges static electricity, it transfers a great deal of electric charge all at once. Such a sudden and large discharge of electricity isnt useful. You cant plug a toaster into a lightning bolt! To power appliances and other electric devices, you need a source of electricity that provides a relatively small amount of continuously flowing electric charges. The solution is an electric current. </p>
