        <h3>Space Shuttles and Space Stations</h3>
        <p>While the United States continued missions to the Moon in the early 1970s, the Soviets worked to build a space station. A space station is a large spacecraft. People can live on this craft for a long period of time. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Early Space Stations</h3>
        <p>Between 1971 and 1982, the Soviets put a total of seven Salyut space stations into orbit. Figure 23.22 shows the last of these, Salyut 7. These were all temporary stations. They were launched and later inhabited by a human crew. Three of the Salyut stations were used for secret military purposes. The others were used to study the problems of living in space. Cosmonauts aboard the stations performed a variety of experiments in astronomy, biology, and Earth science. Salyut 6 and Salyut 7 each had two docking ports. One crew could dock a spacecraft to one end. A replacement crew could dock to the other end. The U.S. only launched one space station during this time. It was called Skylab. Skylab was launched in May 1973. Three crews visited Skylab, all within its first year in orbit. Skylab was used to study the effects of staying in space for long period. Devices on board were and for studying the Sun. Skylab reentered Earths atmosphere in 1979, sooner than expected. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Modular Space Stations</h3>
        <p>The first space station designed for long-term use was the Mir space station (Figure 23.23). Mir was launched in several separate pieces. These pieces were put together in space. Mir holds the current record for the longest continued presence in space. There were people living on Mir continuously for almost 10 years! Mir was the first major space project in which the United States and Russia worked together. American space shuttles transported supplies and people to and from Mir. American astronauts lived on Mir for many months. This cooperation allowed the two nations to learn from each other. The U.S. learned about Russias experiences with long-duration space flights. Mir was taken out of orbit in 2001. It fell into the Pacific Ocean. </p>

        <h3>The International Space Station</h3>
        <p>The International Space Station, shown in Figure 23.24 is a joint project between the space agencies of many nations These include the United States (NASA), Russia (RKA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA), several European countries (ESA) and the Brazilian Space Agency. The International Space Station is a very large station. It has many different sections and is still being assembled. The station has had people on board since 2000. American space shuttles deliver most of the supplies and equipment to the station. Russian Soyuz spacecraft carry people. The primary purpose of the station is scientific research. This is important because the station has a microgravity environment. Experiments are done in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, physiology and medicine. </p>

        <h3>Space Shuttles</h3>
        <p>NASA wanted a new kind of space vehicle. This vehicle had to be reusable. It had to able to carry large pieces of equipment, such as satellites, space telescopes, or sections of a space station. The new vehicle was called a space shuttle, shown in Figure 23.25. There have been five space shuttles: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavor. A space shuttle has three main parts. You are probably most familiar with the orbiter. This part has wings like At the end of the mission, the orbiter re-enters Earths atmosphere. The outside heats up as it descends. Pilots have to steer the shuttle to the runway very precisely. Space shuttles usually land at Kennedy Space Center or at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The orbiter is later hauled back to Florida on the back of a jet airplane. </p>

The shuttle is launched from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. During launches, the orbiter is attached to a huge fuel tank that contains liquid fuel. On the sides of the fuel tank are two large booster rockets. Figure 23.26 shows the stages of a normal space shuttle mission. Once in space, the orbiter can deliver equipment or supplies to the International Space Station. Astronauts can to repair orbiting equipment such as the Hubble Space Telescope. They may also do experiments directly on board the orbiter.</p>

        <h3>Space Shuttle Disasters</h3>
        <p>The space shuttle program has been very successful. Over 100 mission have been flown. Space shuttle missions have made many scientific discoveries. Crews have launched many satellites. There have been other great achievements in space. However, the program has also had two tragic disasters. The first came just 73 seconds after launch, on January 28, 1986. The space shuttle Challenger disintegrated in mid-air, as shown in Figure 23.27. On board were seven crew members. All of them died. One of them was Christa McAuliffe, who was to be the first teacher in space. The problem was later shown to be an O-ring. This small part was in one of the rocket boosters. Space shuttle missions were put on hold while NASA improved the safety of the shuttles. The second occurred during the takeoff of the Columbia on January 16, 2003. A small piece of insulating foam broke off the fuel tank. The foam smashed into a tile on the shuttles wing. The tile was part of the shuttles heat shield. The shield protects the shuttle from extremely high temperatures as it reenters the atmosphere. When Columbia returned to Earth on February 3, 2003, it could not withstand the high temperatures. The shuttle broke apart. Again, all seven crew members died. The space shuttle will be retired in 2011. All the remaining shuttle missions will be to the ISS. Orion will replace the shuttle. Known as a Crew Exploration Vehicle, Orion is expected to be ready by 2016. </p>

        <h3>Recent Space Missions</h3>
        <p>The disasters have caused NASA to focus on developing unmanned missions. Missions without a crew are less expensive and less dangerous. These missions still provide a great deal of valuable information. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Space Telescopes</h3>
        <p>Incredible images have come from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Even more incredible scientific discoveries have come from HST. The Hubble was the first telescope in space. It was put into orbit by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990. Since then, four shuttle missions have gone to the Hubble to make repairs and upgrades. The last repair mission to the Hubble happened in 2009. An example of a HST image is in Figure 23.28, </p>

        <h3>Solar System Exploration</h3>
        <p>We continue to explore the solar system. A rover is like a spacecraft on wheels (Figure 23.29). It can wheel around on the surface. Scientists on Earth tell it where to go. The craft then collects and sends back data from that locations. The Mars Pathfinder studied the red planet for nearly three months in 1997. Two more rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, landed on Mars in 2004. Both were only designed to last 90 days, but have lasted many times longer. Spirit sent back data until it became stuck in January 2010. Opportunity continues to explore Mars. Several spacecraft are currently in orbit, studying the Martian surface and thin atmosphere. </p>

The Cassini mission has been studying Saturn, including its rings and moons, since 2004. The Huygens probe is studying Saturns moon Titan. Titan has some of the conditions that are needed to support life. Some missions visit the smaller objects in our solar system. The Deep Impact Probe collided with a comet in 2005. The probe sent back data from the impact. The Stardust mission visited another comet. There it collected tiny dust particles. Missions are underway to study some asteroids and Pluto. Small objects in our solar system may help us to understand how the solar system formed.</p>

        <h3>Future Missions</h3>
        <p>Budget concerns have impacted NASA in recent years. Many scientists have come together to discuss the goals of the U.S. space program. Some would like to further explore the Moon. Others are interested in landing on Mars. A variety of destinations in the inner solar system may also be visited. Private aerospace companies will play more of a role in the coming years. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The Soviet Union put seven Salyut space stations into orbit between 1971 and 1982. The United States first space station was Skylab. Skylab was in orbit from 1973 to 1979. The Soviet (later Russian) space station Mir was the first modular space station. The International Space Station involves many countries. Space shuttles are reusable vehicles for American astronauts to get into space. Recent space missions have mostly used small spacecraft, such as satellites and space probes, without crews. </p>

        <p>To date, a total of 22 people have died on space missions. In the two space shuttle disasters alone, 14 people died. However, space exploration and research have led to many great discoveries and new technologies. Do you think sending people into space is worth the risk? Why or why not? In the past several years, private companies have been developing vehicles and launch systems that can take people into space. What applications can you think of for such vehicles? What advantages and disadvantages are there to private companies building and launching spacecraft? </p>
