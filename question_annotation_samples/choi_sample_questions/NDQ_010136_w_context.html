        <h3>Blood Pressure</h3>
        <p>The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system. One measure of the health of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure. Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels. Blood in veins is not under much pressure. </p>

        <h3>Healthy Blood Pressure Ranges</h3>
        <p>Blood pressure is read as two numbers. The first number is the systolic pressure. The systolic pressure is the pressure on the blood vessels when the heart beats. This is the time when there is the highest pressure in the arteries. The diastolic pressure, which is the second number, is when your blood pressure is lowest, when the heart is resting between beats. Healthy ranges for blood pressure are: Systolic: less than 120 Diastolic: less than 80 Blood pressure is written as systolic/diastolic. For example, a reading of 120/80 is said as "one twenty over eighty." These measures of blood pressure can change with each heartbeat and over the course of the day. Pressure varies with exercise, emotions, sleep, stress, nutrition, drugs, or disease. Studies have shown that people whose systolic pressure is around 115, rather than 120, have fewer health problems. Clinical trials have shown that people who have blood pressures at the low end of these ranges have much better long term cardiovascular health. Blood pressure is measured with a sphygmomanometer ( Figure 1.1). A digital sphygmomanometer is made of an inflatable cuff and a pressure meter to measure blood pressure. This reading shows a blood pressure of 126/70. Hypertension, which is also called "high blood pressure," occurs when a persons blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a persons systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the persons diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a persons chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the "silent killer." Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Some health conditions, as well as a persons lifestyle and genetic background, can put someone at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure. As a person cannot alter their genetic background, lifestyle changes may be necessary to reduce the chance of developing high blood pressure. These changes include getting enough exercise, limiting the amount of sodium (salt) in the diet, not being overweight, not drinking alcohol to excess, and not smoking. Low blood pressure is not usually a concern, as long as there are no problems associated with the low pressure. Symptoms associated with low blood pressure include dizziness or lightheadedness, fainting, dehydration and unusual thirst, lack of concentration, blurred vision, nausea, and fatigue. </p>
