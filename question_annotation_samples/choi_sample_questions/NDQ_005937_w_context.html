        <h3>El Nio Southern Oscillation</h3>
        <p>Short-term changes in climate are common and they have many causes (Figure 1.1). The largest and most important of these is the oscillation between El Nio and La Nia conditions. This cycle is called the ENSO (El Nio Southern Oscillation). The ENSO drives changes in climate that are felt around the world about every two to seven years. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Normal Conditions</h3>
        <p>In a normal year, the trade winds blow across the Pacific Ocean near the Equator from east to west (toward Asia). A low pressure cell rises above the western equatorial Pacific. Warm water in the western Pacific Ocean raises sea levels by half a meter. Along the western coast of South America, the Peru Current carries cold water northward, and then westward along the Equator with the trade winds. Upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters from the deep sea. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>El Nio</h3>
        <p>In an El Nio year, when water temperature reaches around 28o C (82o F), the trade winds weaken or reverse direction and blow east (toward South America) (Figure 1.2). Warm water is dragged back across the Pacific Ocean and piles up off the west coast of South America. With warm, low-density water at the surface, upwelling stops. Without upwelling, nutrients are scarce and plankton populations decline. Since plankton form the base of the food web, fish cannot find food, and fish numbers decrease as well. All the animals that eat fish, including birds and humans, are affected by the decline in fish. By altering atmospheric and oceanic circulation, El Nio events change global climate patterns. Some regions receive more than average rainfall, including the west coast of North and South America, the southern United States, and Western Europe. Drought occurs in other parts of South America, the western Pacific, southern and northern Africa, and southern Europe. An El Nio cycle lasts one to two years. Often, normal circulation patterns resume. Sometimes circulation patterns bounce back quickly and extremely (Figure 1.3). This is a La Nia. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>La Nia</h3>
        <p>In a La Nia year, as in a normal year, trade winds moves from east to west and warm water piles up in the western Pacific Ocean. Ocean temperatures along coastal South America are colder than normal (instead of warmer, as in El Nio). Cold water reaches farther into the western Pacific than normal. Other important oscillations are smaller and have a local, rather than global, effect. The North Atlantic Oscillation mostly alters climate in Europe. The Mediterranean also goes through cycles, varying between being dry at some times and warm and wet at others. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>El Nio and La Nia are two examples of short-term climate changes lasting one to a few years. In an El Nio, the trade winds reverse direction, as do the equatorial surface currents, causing warm water to pool off of South America and stop upwelling. A La Nia is like normal conditions only more so. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. Describe what happens with wind and current directions during an El Nio event. 2. Why does an El Nio cause a collapse of the food chain off of South America? 3. How does a La Nia event compare with an El Nio event? </p>
