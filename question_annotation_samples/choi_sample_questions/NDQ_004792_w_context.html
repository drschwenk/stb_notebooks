        <h3>Heat Waves</h3>
        <p>A heat wave is different depending on its location. According to the World Meteorological Organization, a region is in a heat wave if it has more than five consecutive days of temperatures that are more than 9 F (5 C) above average. Heat waves have increased in frequency and duration in recent years. The summer 2011 North American heat wave brought record temperatures across the Midwestern and Eastern United States. Many states and localities broke records for temperatures and for most days above 100 F. </p>

        <h3>Causes</h3>
        <p>A high pressure cell sitting over a region with no movement is the likely cause of a heat wave. What do you think caused the heat wave in the image below (Figure 1.1)? A high pressure zone kept the jet stream further north than normal for August. A heat wave over the United States as in- dicated by heat radiated from the ground. The bright yellow areas are the hottest and the blue and white are coolest. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Droughts</h3>
        <p>Droughts also depend on what is normal for a region. When a region gets significantly less precipitation than normal for an extended period of time, it is in drought. The Southern United States is experiencing an ongoing and prolonged drought. Drought has many consequences. When soil loses moisture it may blow away, as happened during the Dust Bowl in the United States in the 1930s. Forests may be lost, dust storms may become common, and wildlife are disturbed. Wildfires become much more common during times of drought. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Its hard to define a heat wave or a drought because these phenomena depend are deviations from normal conditions in a region. A heat wave is caused when a warm high-pressure cell sits over a region. Drought may have extremely severe consequences depending on its duration and intensity. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. How is a heat wave defined? 2. How is a drought defined? 3. How does the position of the jet stream cause a heat wave? </p>
