        <h3>Reflection of Light</h3>
        <p>Almost all surfaces reflect some of the light that strikes them. The still water of the lake in Figure 22.9 reflects almost all of the light that strikes it. The reflected light forms an image of nearby objects. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected or refracted light. </p>

        <h3>Regular and Diffuse Reflection</h3>
        <p>If a surface is extremely smooth, like very still water, then an image formed by reflection is sharp and clear. This is called regular reflection. If the surface is even slightly rough, an image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reflection. Both types of reflection are represented in Figure 22.10. You can also see animations of both types of reflection at this URL: http://toolboxes.flexiblelearning.net.au/demosites/serie In Figure 22.10, the waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, in contrast, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. </p>

        <h3>Law of Reflection</h3>
        <p>One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection. The angle at which the reflected rays bounce off the surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. This is the law of reflection, and it applies to the reflection of all light. The law is illustrated in Figure 22.11 and in the animation at this URL: </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 22.11 According to the law of reflection, the an- gle of reflection always equals the angle of incidence. The angles of both reflected and incident light are measured relative to an imaginary line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the reflective surface.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mirrors</h3>
        <p>Mirrors are usually made of glass with a shiny metal backing that reflects all the light that strikes it. Mirrors may have flat or curved surfaces. The shape of a mirrors surface determines the type of image the mirror forms. For example, the image may be real or virtual. A real image forms in front of a mirror where reflected light rays actually meet. It is a true image that could be projected on a screen. A virtual image appears to be on the other side of the mirror. Of course, reflected rays dont actually go behind a mirror, so a virtual image doesnt really exist. It just appears to exist to the human eye and brain. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Plane Mirrors</h3>
        <p>Most mirrors are plane mirrors. A plane mirror has a flat reflective surface and forms only virtual images. The image formed by a plane mirror is also life sized. But something is different about the image compared with the real object in front of the mirror. Left and right are reversed. Look at the man shaving in Figure 22.12. He is using his right hand to hold the razor, but his image appears to be holding the razor in the left hand. Almost all plane mirrors reverse left and right in this way. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Concave Mirrors</h3>
        <p>Some mirrors have a curved rather than flat surface. Curved mirrors can be concave or convex. A concave mirror is shaped like the inside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms either real or virtual images, depending on where the object is placed relative to the focal point. The focal point is the point in front of the mirror where the reflected rays intersect. You can see how concave mirrors form images in Figure 22.13 and in the interactive animation at the URL below. The animation allows you to move an object to see how its position affects the image. Concave mirrors are used behind car headlights. They focus the light and make it brighter. They are also used in some telescopes. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Convex Mirrors</h3>
        <p>The other type of curved mirror, a convex mirror, is shaped like the outside of a bowl. This type of mirror forms only virtual images. The image is always right-side up and smaller than the actual object, which makes the object appear farther away than it really is. You can see how a convex mirror forms an image in Figure 22.14 and in the animation at the URL below. Because of their shape, convex mirrors can gather and reflect light from a wide area. This is why they are used as side mirrors on cars. They give the driver a wider view of the area around the vehicle than a plane mirror would. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Refraction of Light</h3>
        <p>Although the speed of light is constant in a vacuum, light travels at different speeds in different kinds of matter. For example, light travels more slowly in glass than in air. Therefore, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down. If light strikes a sheet of glass straight on, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but passes straight through. However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90 , the wave refracts, or bends. This is illustrated in Figure change in speed, the more light bends. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Lenses</h3>
        <p>Lenses make use of the refraction of light to create images. A lens is a transparent object, typically made of glass, with one or two curved surfaces. The more curved the surface of a lens is, the more it refracts light. Like mirrors, lenses may be concave or convex. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Concave Lenses</h3>
        <p>Concave lenses are thicker at the edges than in the middle. They cause rays of light to diverge, or spread apart. Figure 22.16 shows how a concave lens forms an image. The image is always virtual and on the same side of the lens as the object. The image is also right-side up and smaller than the object. Concave lenses are used in cameras. They focus reduced images inside the camera, where they are captured and stored. You can explore the formation of images by a concave lens with the interactive animation at this URL: http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/geometric-opti </p>

        <h3>Convex Lenses</h3>
        <p>Convex lenses are thicker in the middle than at the edges. They cause rays of light to converge, or meet, at a point called the focus (F). Convex lenses form either real or virtual images. It depends on how close an object is to the lens relative to the focus. Figure 22.17 shows how a convex lens works. You can also interact with an animated convex lens at the URL below. An example of a convex lens is a hand lens. </p>

        <h3>Optical Instruments</h3>
        <p>Mirrors and lenses are used in optical instruments to reflect and refract light. Optical instruments include micro- scopes, telescopes, cameras, and lasers. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Light Microscopes</h3>
        <p>A light microscope is an instrument that uses lenses to make enlarged images of objects that are too small for the unaided eye to see. A common type of light microscope is a compound microscope, like the one in Figure 22.18. A compound microscope has at least two convex lenses: one or more objective lenses and one or more eyepiece lenses. The objective lenses are close to the object being viewed. They form an enlarged image of the object inside the microscope. The eyepiece lenses are close to the viewers eyes. They form an enlarged image of the first image. The magnifications of all the lenses are multiplied together to yield the overall magnification of the microscope. Some light microscopes can magnify objects more than 1000 times!

        <h3>Telescopes</h3>
        <p>Like microscopes, telescopes use convex lenses to make enlarged images. However, telescopes make enlarged images of objectssuch as distant starsthat only appear tiny because they are very far away. There are two basic types of telescopes: reflecting telescopes and refracting telescopes. The two types are compared in Figure 22.19. You can learn more about telescopes and how they evolved in the video at this URL: </p>

        <h3>Cameras</h3>
        <p>A camera is an optical instrument that records an image of an object. The image may be recorded on film or it may be detected by an electronic sensor that stores the image digitally. Regardless of how the image is recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as demonstrated in Figure 22.20 and at the URL below. Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters the camera through an opening called the aperture. As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image. The image focuses on film (or a sensor) at the back of the camera. The lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus. The shutter controls the amount of light that strikes the film (or sensor). It stays open longer in dim light to let more light in.

        <h3>Lasers</h3>
        <p>Did you ever see a cat chase after a laser light, like the one in Figure 22.21? A laser is a device that produces a very focused beam of light of just one wavelength and color. Waves of laser light are synchronized so the crests and troughs of the waves line up (see Figure 22.21). Laser light is created in a tube like the one shown in Figure 22.22. Electrons in a material such as a ruby crystal are stimulated to radiate photons of light of one wavelength. At each end of the tube is a concave mirror. The photons of light bounce back and forth in the tube off the mirrors. This focuses the light. The mirror at one end of the tube is partly transparent. A constant stream of photons passes through the transparent part, forming the laser beam. You can see an animation showing how a laser works at this URL:  (1:12). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Besides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses. It is used to scan bar codes, for example, and to carry communication signals in optical fibers. Optical fibers are extremely thin glass tubes that are used to guide laser light (see Figure 22.23). Sounds or pictures are encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical fiber. All of the light reflects off the inside of the fiber, so none of it escapes. As a result, the signal remains strong even over long distances. More than one signal can travel through an optic fiber at the same time, as you can see in Figure 22.23. Optical fibers are used to carry telephone, cable TV, and Internet signals. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Objects that reflect or refract light may form images. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected or refracted light. According to the law of reflection, light is reflected at the same angle that it strikes a reflective surface. Mirrors reflect all of the light that strikes them and form images. A plane, or flat, mirror forms virtual, life- sized images. A concave mirror forms either enlarged virtual images or reduced real images. A convex mirror forms only reduced virtual images. Refraction, or bending, of light occurs when light passes from one medium to another at an angle other than 90 and the speed of light changes in the new medium. The greater the change in speed, the more light bends. Lenses are transparent objects with curved surfaces that refract light and form images. Concave lenses form only reduced virtual images. Convex lenses form either enlarged virtual images or real images that may be enlarged or reduced. Mirrors and lenses are used in optical instruments to reflect or refract light. Optical instruments include microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and lasers. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Did you ever see trees or other objects reflected in the still waters of a lake, like the one in Figure 22.9? The water in the lake is so calm that it reflects visible light almost as clearly as a mirror. A mirror is one of many devices that people use to extend their ability to see. Mirrors allow people to see themselves as other people see them and also to see behind their back. Mirrors are also used in instruments such as telescopes, which you will read about in this lesson. The use of light in devices such as these is possible because of optics. Optics is the study of visible light and the ways it can be used to extend human vision and do other tasks. </p>

        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Define optics. State the law of reflection. What type of images does a convex mirror form? What type of images does a concave lens form? Choose an optical instrument described in this lesson and state how it uses lenses and/or mirrors to focus visible light. </p>
