        <h3>What Is Technology</h3>
        <p>Technology is the application of knowledge to real-world problems. It includes methods and processes as well as devices like computers and cars. An example is the Bessemer process. It is a cheap method of making steel that was invented in the 1850s. It is just one of many technological advances that have occurred in manufacturing. Technology is also responsible for most of the major advances in agriculture, transportation, communications, and medicine. Clearly, technology has had a huge impact on people and society. It is hard to imagine what life would be like without it. Professionals in technology are generally called engineers. Most engineers have a strong background in physical science. There are many different careers in engineering. You can learn about some of them at the URLs below. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Technological Design</h3>
        <p>The development of new technology is called technological design. It is similar to scientific investigation. Both processes use evidence and logic to solve problems. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Technological Design Process</h3>
        <p>Figure 2.13 shows the steps of the technological design process. Consider the problem of developing a solar- powered car. Many questions would have to be researched in the design process. For example, what is the best shape for gathering the suns rays? How will the energy from the sun be stored? Will a back-up energy source be needed? After researching the answers, possible designs are developed. This takes imagination as well as reason. Then a model is made of the best design, and the model is tested. This allows any problems with the design to be worked out before a final design is selected. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Constraints on Technological Design</h3>
        <p>Technological design always has constraints. Constraints are limits on the design. Common constraints include: laws of nature, such as the law of gravity. properties of the materials used. cost of producing a technology. Ethical concerns are also constraints on many technological designs. Like scientists, engineers must follow ethical rules. For example, the technologies they design must be as safe as possible for people and the environment. Engineers must weigh the benefits and risks of new technologies, and the benefits should outweigh the risks. </p>

        <h3>Advances in Technology</h3>
        <p>Technology advances as new materials and processes are invented. Computers are a good example. Table 2.5 and the videos below show some of the milestones in their evolution. The evolution of modern computers began in the 1930s. Computers are still evolving today. How have computers changed during your lifetime?  (4:11) MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

URL:  Computer (Year) ENIAC (1946) US Army Photo ERMA (1955) Description Like other early computers, the huge ENIAC computer used vacuum tubes for electrical signals. This made it very large and expensive. It could do just one task at a time. It had to be rewired to change programs. Thats what the women in this photo are doing. The ERMA computer represented a new computer technology. It used transistors instead of vacuum tubes. This allowed computers to be smaller, cheaper, and more energy efficient. Computer (Year) PDP-8 (1968) Description By the late 1960s, tiny transistors on silicon chips were invented. They increased the speed and efficiency of computers. They also allowed computers to be much smaller. The PDP-8 computer pictured here was the first "mini" computer. Macintosh 128K (1984) The next major advance in computers was the develop- ment of microprocessors. A microprocessor consisted of thousands of integrated circuits placed on a tiny sili- con chip. This allowed computers to be more powerful and even smaller. The computer pictured here is the first Macintosh personal computer. MacBook Air (2010) The computers of the 21st century are tiny compared with the lumbering giants of the mid-1900s. Their problem-solving abilities are also immense compared with early computers. The diversity of software pro- grams available today allows users to undertake an immense variety of tasks and no rewiring is needed! </p>

        <h3>Technology and Science</h3>
        <p>Technology is sometimes referred to as applied science, but it has a different goal than science. The goal of science is to increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to use knowledge for practical purposes. Although they have different goals, technology and science work hand in hand. Each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is needed to create new technologies. New technologies are used to further science. The microscope is a good example. Scientific knowledge of light allowed 17th century lens makers to make the first microscopes. This new technology let scientists view a world of tiny objects they had never before seen.

        <h3>KQED Darfur Stoves Project</h3>
        <p>Everyday, women living in the refugee camps of Darfur, Sudan must walk for up to seven hours outside the safety of the camps to collect firewood for cooking, putting them at risk for violent attacks. Now, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have engineered a more efficient wood-burning stove, which is greatly reducing both the womens need for firewood and the threats against them.

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>What do you think of when you hear the word technology? Do devices like computers and solar-powered cars come to mind? Devices such as these are just one meaning of the term "technology." As a field of study, technology is much broader than that. </p>
