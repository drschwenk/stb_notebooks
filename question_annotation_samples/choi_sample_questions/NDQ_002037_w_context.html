        <h3>Reducing Air Pollution from Fossil Fuels</h3>
        <p>There are two basic types of strategies for reducing pollution from fossil fuels: 1. Use less fossil fuel to begin with. 2. When fossil fuels must be used, prevent the pollution from entering the air. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Less Fossil Fuel</h3>
        <p>We can reduce our use of fossil fuels in several ways: Conserve fossil fuels. For example, turning out lights when we arent using them saves electricity. Why does this help? A lot of the electricity we use comes from coal-burning power plants. Use fossil fuels more efficiently. For example, driving a fuel-efficient car lets you go farther on each gallon of gas. This can add up to a big savings in fossil fuel use. Change to alternative energy sources that produce little or no air pollution. For example, hybrid cars run on electricity that would be wasted during braking. These cars use gas only as a backup fuel. As a result, they produce just 10 percent of the air pollution produced by cars that run only on gas. Cars that run on hydrogen and produce no pollution at all have also been developed (see Figure 22.14). </p>

        <h3>Keeping Pollutants out of the Air</h3>
        <p>Some of the pollutants from fossil fuels can be filtered out of exhaust before it is released into the air. Other pollutants can be changed to harmless compounds before they are released. Two widely used technologies are scrubbers and catalytic converters. Scrubbers are used in factories and power plants. They remove particulates and waste gases from exhaust before it is released to the air. You can see how a scrubber works in Figure 22.15. Catalytic converters are used on motor vehicles. They break down pollutants in exhaust to non-toxic com- pounds. For example, they change nitrogen oxides to harmless nitrogen and oxygen gasses. </p>

        <h3>Preventing Ozone Loss and Global Warming</h3>
        <p>The problems of ozone loss and global warming were unknown in 1970. When they were discovered, worldwide efforts were made to reduce CFCs and carbon dioxide emissions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Protecting the Ozone Layer</h3>
        <p>The Montreal Protocol is a worldwide agreement on air pollution. It focuses on CFCs. It was signed by many countries in 1987. It controls almost 100 chemicals that can damage the ozone layer. Its aim is to return the ozone layer to its normal state. The Montreal Protocol has been effective in controlling CFCs. By 1995, few CFCs were still being used. But the ozone hole kept growing for several years after that because of the CFCs already in the atmosphere. It peaked in 2006. Since then, it has been somewhat smaller. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Controlling Global Warming</h3>
        <p>The Kyoto Protocol is another worldwide agreement on air pollution. It was passed in 1997. The Protocol focuses on controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Its aim is to control global warming. Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas causing global warming. There are several possible ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They include cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes, and carbon sequestration In a cap-and-trade system, each nation is given a cap, or upper limit, on carbon dioxide emissions. If a nation needs to go over its cap, it can trade with another nation that is below its cap. Figure 22.16 shows how this works. Carbon taxes are taxes placed on gasoline and other products that produce carbon dioxide. The taxes encourage people to use less fossil fuel, which reduces carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon sequestration is any way of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in another form. Carbon is sequestered naturally by forests. Trees take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Artificial methods of sequestering carbon underground are being researched. The Kyoto Protocol has not been as successful as the Montreal Protocol. One reason is that the worlds biggest producer of greenhouse gases, the U.S., did not sign the Kyoto Protocol. Of the nations that signed it, few are </p>

A stricter agreement must be reached very soon. Unfortunately, efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions are mired in politics. Meanwhile, crucial time is being lost.</p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>There are two basic strategies for reducing pollution from fossil fuels: using less fossil fuel and keeping pollution from fossil fuel use out of the air. The Montreal Protocol of 1987 bans CFCs. The purpose is to protect the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The Kyoto Protocol of 1997 regulates greenhouse gases. The goal is to control global warming. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The Clean Air Act of 1970 regulates six major pollutants. These pollutants are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulates. Since 1970, these pollutants have decreased by more than 50 percent. How has air pollution been reduced? Most methods deal with the chief cause of air pollution: fossil fuel burning. Global warming is an important effect of human activities on the atmosphere. The causes and effects of climate change were discussed in the Climate chapter. However, ways to deal with greenhouse gases are discussed below. </p>
