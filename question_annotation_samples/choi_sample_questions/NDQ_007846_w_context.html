        <h3>The Heart</h3>
        <p>The heart is a muscular organ in the chest. It consists mainly of cardiac muscle tissue. It pumps blood by repeated, rhythmic contractions. This produces the familiar lub-dub sound of each heartbeat. For a good video introduction to the heart and how it works, watch this entertaining Bill Nye video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure of the Heart</h3>
        <p>The heart has four chambers, or rooms, which you can see in Figure 18.3. Each chamber is an empty space with muscular walls through which blood can flow. The top two chambers of the heart are called the left and right atria (atrium, singular). The atria of the heart receive blood from the body or lungs and pump it into the bottom chambers of the heart. The bottom two chambers of the heart are called the left and right ventricles. The ventricles receive blood from the atria and pump it out of the heart, either to the lungs or to the rest of the body. Flaps of tissue called valves separate the hearts chambers. Valves keep blood flowing in just one direction through the heart. For example, a valve at the bottom of the right atrium opens to let blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. Then the valve closes so the blood cant flow back into the right atrium. </p>

        <h3>How Blood Flows Through the Heart</h3>
        <p>Blood flows through the heart in two paths. Trace these two paths in Figure 18.4 as you read about them below. You can also learn about how blood flows through the heart with this rap:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  1. One path of blood in the heart is through the right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium receives oxygen- poor blood from the body. It pumps the blood into the right ventricle. Then the right ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the lungs. This path through the heart is part of the pulmonary circulation. 2. The other path of blood in the heart is through the left atrium and left ventricle. The left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. It pumps the blood into the left ventricle. Then the left ventricle pumps the blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. This path through the heart is part of the systemic circulation. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 18.4 Blood flows through the heart along two different paths, shown here by blue and red arrows. Notice where valves open and close to keep the blood moving in just one direction along each path.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How the Heart Beats</h3>
        <p>To move blood through the heart, cardiac muscles must contract in a certain sequence. First the atria must contract, followed quickly by the ventricles contracting. This series of contractions keeps blood moving continuously through the heart. Contractions of cardiac muscles arent under voluntary control. They are controlled by a cluster of special cells within the heart, commonly called the pacemaker. These cells send electrical signals to cardiac muscles so they contract in the correct sequence and with just the right timing. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Blood Vessels</h3>
        <p>Blood vessels are long, tube-like organs that consist mainly of muscle, connective, and epithelial tissues. They branch to form a complex network of vessels that run throughout the body. This network transports blood to all the bodys cells. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Blood Vessels</h3>
        <p>There are three major types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. You can see each type in Figure 18.5. You can watch a good video introduction to the three types at this link:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Arteries are muscular blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart. They have thick walls that can withstand the pressure of blood pumped by the heart. Arteries generally carry oxygen-rich blood. The largest artery is the aorta, which receives blood directly from the heart. It branches to form smaller and smaller arteries throughout the body. The smallest arteries are called arterioles. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood toward the heart. This blood is no longer under pressure, so veins have thinner walls. To keep the blood moving, many veins have valves that prevent the backflow of blood. Veins generally carry oxygen-poor blood. The smallest veins are called venules. They merge to form larger and larger veins. The largest vein is the inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body directly to the heart. Capillaries are the smallest type of blood vessels. They connect the smallest arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules). Exchange of substances between cells and the blood takes place across the walls of capillaries, which may be only one cell thick. </p>

        <h3>Blood Vessels and Homeostasis</h3>
        <p>Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either dilating (widening) or constricting (narrowing). This changes the amount of blood flowing to particular organs. For example, dilation of blood vessels in the skin allows more blood to flow to the surface of the body. This helps the body lose excess heat. Constriction of these blood vessels has the opposite effect and helps the body conserve heat. </p>

        <h3>Cardiovascular Health</h3>
        <p>Diseases of the cardiovascular system are common and may be life threatening. A healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of such diseases developing. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Diseases of the Cardiovascular System</h3>
        <p>Diseases of the heart and blood vessels are called cardiovascular diseases. The leading cause of cardiovascular disease is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which a material called plaque builds up inside arteries. Plaque consists of cell debris, cholesterol, and other substances. As plaque builds up in an artery, the artery narrows, as shown in Figure If plaque blocks coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, coronary heart disease results. Poor blood flow to the heart may cause chest pain or a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when the blood supply to part of the heart muscle is completely blocked so that cardiac muscle cells die. Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in U.S adults. </p>

        <h3>Keeping the Cardiovascular System Healthy</h3>
        <p>Many factors influence your risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Some of these factors you cant control. Older age, male gender, and a family history of cardiovascular disease all increase the risk and cant be controlled. However, you can control many other factors. To reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, you can: avoid smoking. get regular physical activity. maintain a healthy percent of body fat. eat a healthy, low-fat diet. get regular checkups to detect and manage problems such as high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The heart is a muscular organ in the chest that consists mainly of cardiac muscle. It pumps blood through blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. Blood flows through four chambers of the heart when it beats. Heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals from special cells within the heart called the pacemaker. Blood vessels are long, tube-like organs that form a complex network throughout the body. They transport blood to all the bodys cells. There are three types of blood vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Transfer of substances between the blood and cells takes place across the thin walls of capillaries. Diseases of the cardiovascular system are common and may be life threatening. Examples include atheroscle- rosis and coronary heart disease. A healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of such diseases developing. This includes avoiding smoking, getting regular physical activity, and maintaining a healthy percent of body fat. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Transporting blood is the main job of the heart and blood vessels. 1. What is blood? What is it made of? 2. What substances are transported around the body in blood? </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>You can exercise your skeletal muscles, like the bicep muscles in your upper arms, by lifting weights. In between repetitions of the exercise, you let the muscles relax and rest. Unlike your skeletal muscles, your heart muscle cant rest. It must keep contracting and pumping blood continuously throughout your life. Obviously, the heart is a very special organ. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Describe the structure of the heart. 2. Give an example of homeostasis involving blood vessels. 3. Define cardiovascular diseases. </p>
