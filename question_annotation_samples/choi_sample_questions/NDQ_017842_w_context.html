        <h3>Force Mass and Acceleration</h3>
        <p>Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration occurs whenever an unbalanced force acts on an object. Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object and the objects mass. Newtons second law of motion describes how force and mass affect acceleration. The law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the objects mass. This can be represented by the equation: Acceleration = or a = Net force Mass F m Q: While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is acting on the skates? A: Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see in the Figure 1.1, first with one skate and then with the other. This force pushes him forward. Although friction partly counters the forward motion of the skates, it is weaker than the force Tony exerts. Therefore, there is a net forward force on the skates. </p>

        <h3>Direct and Inverse Relationships</h3>
        <p>Newtons second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration. The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force. Q: Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing (pictured in the opening image). How will this affect his acceleration around the track? A: Tonys greater mass will result in less acceleration for the same amount of force. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Newtons second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the objects mass. According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration and an inverse relationship between mass and acceleration. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. 2. 3. 4. State Newtons second law of motion. How can Newtons second law of motion be represented with an equation? If the net force acting on an object doubles, how will the objects acceleration be affected? Tony has a mass of 50 kg, and his friend Sam has a mass of 45 kg. Assume that both friends push off on their rollerblades with the same force. Explain which boy will have greater acceleration. </p>
