        <h3>Earths Magnetism</h3>
        <p>Earth is surrounded by a magnetic field (Figure 1.1) that behaves as if the planet had a gigantic bar magnet inside of it. Earths magnetic field also has a north and south pole. The magnetic field arises from the convection of molten iron and nickel metals in Earths liquid outer core. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Magnetic Reversals</h3>
        <p>Many times during Earth history, even relatively recent Earth history, the planets magnetic field has flipped. That is, the north pole becomes the south pole and the south pole becomes the north pole. Scientists are not sure why this happens. One hypothesis is that the convection that drives the magnetic field becomes chaotic and then reverses itself. Another hypothesis is that an external event, such as an asteroid impact, disrupts motions in the core and causes the reversal. The first hypothesis is supported by computer models, but the second does not seem to be supported by much data. There is little correlation between impact events and magnetic reversals.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Earths magnetic field is like a bar magnet through the planet, with the south magnetic pole nearly aligned with the north geographic pole and vice versa. The magnetic field is generated by convection in the liquid outer core. Occasionally the magnetic field flips, with the north pole becoming the south pole and the south pole becoming the north pole. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. What would Earths magnetic field be like if the planet was solid and why? 2. What important role does the magnetic field play for our planet? 3. How does the magnetic field resemble a bar magnet? </p>
