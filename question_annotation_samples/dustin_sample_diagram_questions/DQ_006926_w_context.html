        <h3>What Is Respiration</h3>
        <p>The bodys exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air is called respiration. Respiration actually consists of two stages. In one stage, air is taken into the body and carbon dioxide is released to the outside air. In the other stage, oxygen is delivered to all the cells of the body and carbon dioxide is carried away from the cells. Another kind of respiration takes place within body cells. This kind of respiration is called cellular respiration. Its the process in which cells obtain energy by burning glucose. Both types of respiration are connected. Cellular respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. Respiration by the respiratory system supplies the oxygen needed for cellular respiration. It also removes the carbon dioxide produced by cellular respiration. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structures of the Respiratory System</h3>
        <p>You can see the main structures of the respiratory system in Figure 19.1. They include the nose, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. Use the figure to trace how air moves through the respiratory system when you read about it below. You can also use this interactive to explore the respiratory system and see how it functions: http://science.nationalgeogr </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Steps in Respiration</h3>
        <p>Take in a big breath of air through your nose. As you breathe in, you may feel the air pass down through your throat and notice your chest expand. Now breathe out and observe the opposite events occurring. Breathing in and out may seem like simple actions, but they are just part of the complex process of respiration. Respiration actually occurs in four steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. breathing (inhaling and exhaling) gas exchange between the air and blood gas transport by the blood gas exchange between the blood and cells </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Breathing</h3>
        <p>Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. You can see it in Figure 19.2. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm contracts. This increases the size of the chest, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. The difference in air pressure between the lungs and outside air causes air to rush into the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. The difference in air pressure between the lungs and outside air causes air to rush out of the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened so it wont harm delicate tissues of the lungs. Next, air passes through the pharynx, a passageway that is shared with the digestive system. From the pharynx, the air passes next through the larynx, or voice box. After the larynx, air moves into the trachea, or wind pipe. This is a long tube that leads down to the lungs in the chest. In the chest, the trachea divides as it enters the lungs to form the right and left bronchi (bronchus, singular). These passages are covered with mucus and tiny hairs called cilia. The mucus traps any remaining particles in the air. The cilia move and sweep the particles and mucus toward the throat so they can be expelled from the body. Air passes from the bronchi into smaller passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular). </p>

        <h3>Gas Exchange Between the Air and Blood</h3>
        <p>The alveoli in the lungs are where gas exchange between the air and blood takes place. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of capillaries. When you inhale, air in the alveoli has a greater concentration of oxygen than does blood in the capillaries. The difference in oxygen concentration causes oxygen to diffuse from the air into the blood. You can see how this occurs in Figure 19.3. Unlike oxygen, carbon dioxide is more concentrated in the blood in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli than it is in the air inside the alveoli. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses in the opposite direction. It moves out of the blood and into the air. </p>

        <h3>Gas Transport in the Blood</h3>
        <p>After the blood in the capillaries in the lungs picks up oxygen, it leaves the lungs and travels to the heart. The heart pumps the oxygen-rich blood into arteries, which carry it throughout the body. The blood passes eventually into capillaries that supply body cells. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Gas Exchange Between the Blood and Cells</h3>
        <p>The cells of the body have a lower concentration of oxygen that does blood in the capillaries that supply body cells. Therefore, oxygen diffuses from the blood into the cells. Carbon dioxide, which cells produce in cellular respiration, is more concentrated in the cells. Therefore, carbon dioxide diffuses out of the cells and into the blood. The carbon dioxide travels in capillaries to veins and then to the heart. The heart pumps the blood to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide diffuses into the alveoli. It passes out of the body during exhalation. This brings the process of respiration full circle. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Respiratory System Health</h3>
        <p>No doubt youve had the common cold. When you did, you probably had respiratory system symptoms. For example, you may have had a stuffy nose that made it hard to breathe. While you may feel miserable when you have a cold, it is generally a relatively mild disease. Many other respiratory system diseases are more serious. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Diseases of the Respiratory System</h3>
        <p>Common diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema. All of them are diseases of the lungs. You can see some of the changes in the lungs that occur in each of these diseases in Figure 19.4. Asthma is a disease in which bronchioles in the lungs periodically swell and fill with mucus. Symptoms of asthma may include difficulty breathing, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. An asthma attack may be triggered by allergies, strenuous exercise, stress, or another respiratory illness such as a cold. Pneumonia is a disease in which some of the alveoli of the lungs fill with fluid so they can no longer exchange gas. Symptoms of pneumonia typically include coughing, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. Pneumonia may be caused by an infection or an injury to the lungs. Emphysema is a disease in which the walls of the alveoli break down so less gas can be exchanged by the lungs. The main symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath. The damage to the alveoli is usually caused by smoking and is permanent. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Your Respiratory System Healthy</h3>
        <p>The main way to keep your respiratory system healthy is to avoid smoking or breathing in the smoke of others. Smoking causes, or makes you more susceptible to, many respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, em- physema, and lung cancer. Other steps you can take to keep your respiratory system healthy are listed below. Eat well, get enough sleep, and be active every day. These healthy lifestyle choices will help keep your immune system healthy so it can fight off respiratory infections and other diseases. Wash your hands often. This will reduce your risk of picking up viruses or bacteria that could make you sick with colds or other respiratory infections. Avoid contact with other people when they are sick and stay home when you are sick. These steps will help reduce the spread of infectious diseases. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The respiratory system is the body system that exchanges gases with the outside air. It brings air containing oxygen into the body for the cells. It also releases carbon dioxide from the cells into the air. This exchange of gases is called respiration. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. It depends on the muscle called the diaphragm. The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system. This is where gases are exchanged between the air and the blood. Gases are also transported by the blood and exchanged between the blood and all the cells of the body. Common diseases of the respiratory system include asthma, pneumonia, and emphysema. All of them are diseases of the lungs. The main way to keep your respiratory system healthy is to avoid smoking or breathing in the smoke of others. </p>

        <p>This image shows the parts of the human respiratory system. Respiration involves taking in air filled with oxygen into the human body or lungs and releasing carbon dioxide from the body. Respiration involves breathing through the nose/nasal cavity. The air then travels down into the lungs through the pharynx, followed by the larynx and finally through the trachea. The lungs are located in the chest cavity or thoracic cavity along with the heart. The chest cavity are covered by ribs on the outside. The pleura lines the thoracic cavity and envelopes the lungs. The trachea is subdivided into two bronchi before it enters the lungs. The bronchi are further divided into tiny bronchioles inside the lungs. The bronchioles have a tree like structure. The lungs are separated from the abdominal cavity by the diaphragm. The diaphragm contracts while breathing in and relaxes when breathing outs. The process of respiration is controlled by the respiratory centers located in the brain.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the parts of the respiratory system. The human respiratory system is a series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. As we breathe, oxygen enters the nose or mouth and passes the sinuses, which are hollow spaces in the skull. Sinuses help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe. The trachea, also called the windpipe, filters the air that is inhaled, according to the American Lung Association. It branches into the bronchi, which are two tubes that carry air into each lung. The bronchial tubes are lined with tiny hairs called cilia. Cilia move back and forth, carrying mucus up and out. Mucus, a sticky fluid, collects dust, germs and other matter that has invaded the lungs. We expel mucus when we sneeze, cough, spit or swallow.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the structures of the human respiratory system which is a series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. There are 3 major parts of the respiratory system: the airway, the lungs, and the muscles of respiration. The airway includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. In this diagram, we focus on the functions of the nose, mouth, trachea, lungs, and diaphragm. The nose is the primary opening for the respiratory system, made of bone, muscle, and cartilage. The nasal cavity is a cavity within your nose filled with mucus membranes and hairs. Also called the oral cavity, the mouth is the secondary exterior opening for the respiratory system. Most commonly, the majority of respiration is achieved via the nose and nasal cavity, but the mouth can be used if needed. Also known as the wind pipe, the trachea is a tube made of cartilage rings that are lined with pseudo-stratified ciliated columnar epithelium. The lungs work together with the other parts of the respiratory system to allow oxygen in the air to be taken into the body while also enabling the body to get rid of carbon dioxide in the air breathed out. The diaphragm is an important muscle of respiration which is situated beneath the lungs. It contracts to expand the space inside the thoracic cavity, whilst moving a few inches inferiorly into the abdominal cavity.</p>
