        <h3>Types of Volcanoes</h3>
        <p>A composite volcano forms the tall cone shape you usually think of when you think of a volcano. Shield volcanoes are huge, gently sloping volcanoes. Cinder cones are small, cone-shaped volcanoes. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Composite Volcanoes</h3>
        <p>Figure 8.14 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (Figure 8.15). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes. </p>

Frequently there is a large crater at the top from the last eruption.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Shield Volcanoes</h3>
        <p>Shield volcanoes look like a huge ancient warriors shield laid down. Figure 8.16 shows the Kilaeua Volcano. A shield volcano has a very wide base. It is much flatter on the top than a composite volcano. The lava that creates shield volcanoes is reltively thin. The thin lava spreads out. This builds a large, flat volcano layer by layer. Shield volcanoes are very large. For example, the Mauna Loa Volcano has a diameter of more than 112 kilometers (70 miles). The volcano forms a significant part of the island of Hawaii. The top of nearby Mauna Kea Volcano is more than ten kilometers (6 miles) from its base on the seafloor. Shield volcanoes often form along divergent plate boundaries. They also form at hot spots, like Hawaii. Shield volcano eruptions are non-explosive. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Cinder Cones</h3>
        <p>Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano. Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes. But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top of one another. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava. Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield volcanoes have nearby cinder cones. Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short time. Many only produce one eruption. For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes (Figure 8.17). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Calderas</h3>
        <p>During a massive eruption all of the material may be ejected from a magma changer. Without support, the mountain above the empty chamber may collapse. This produces a huge caldera. Calderas are generally round, bowl-shaped formations like the picture in Figure 8.18. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Supervolcanoes</h3>
        <p>Supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano. During an eruption, enormous amounts of ash are thrown into the atmosphere. The ash encircles the globe. This blocks the Sun and lowers the temperature of the entire planet. The result is a volcanic winter. A supervolcano eruption took place at Lake Toba in northern Sumatra about 75,000 years ago (Figure 8.19). This was the largest eruption in the past 25 million years. As much as 2,800 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere. The result was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted. The most recent supervolcano eruption was in New Zealand. The eruption was less than 2000 years ago. For a supervolcano eruption it was small, about 100 cubic kilometers of material. A much larger super eruption in Colorado produced over 5,000 cubic kilometers of material. That eruption was 28 million years ago. It was 5000 times larger than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The largest potentially active supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone. The caldera has had three super eruptions at 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago. The floor of the Yellowstone caldera is slowly rising upwards. Another eruption is very likely but no one knows when. The cause of supervolcano eruptions is being debated. Enormous magma chambers are filled with super hot magma. This enormous eruption leaves a huge hole. The ground collapses and creates a caldera. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. You have been told to visit an erupting volcano. Since you value your life, which type do you choose to visit and why? 5. How does the composition of magma affect the type of volcano that forms? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe the basic shapes of volcanoes.
Compare the features of volcanoes.
Describe the stages in the formation of volcanoes.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Composite cones, shield volcanoes, cinder cones and supervolcanoes are some of the types of volcanoes formed. Composite cones are steep sided, cone shaped volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanic landform. They are formed from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material. A caldera forms when an explosive eruption leaves a large crater when the mountain blows apart. Supervolcanoes are tremendously devastating types of volcanoes that could destroy large areas when they erupt. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>6. Scientists have only recently recognized the existence of supervolcanoes. Why were they the last type of volcano discovered? 7. The largest volcano in the solar system is not on Earth. What is needed for there to be an enormous volcano? What does this tell us about planets with enormous volcanoes? </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Composite volcanoes usually have craters on the top. Why are the craters sometimes U or horseshoe- shaped? A shield volcano is relatively flat, and a composite volcano is relatively steep because of the type of magma that creates them. What type of lava might create a volcano that is steeper than a shield volcano but not as steep as a composite volcano? Some people believe there would be a worldwide catastrophe if a huge asteroid hits the Earth. How might an asteroid impact and a supervolcano eruption be similar? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Some volcanoes are tall, cone-shaped mountains. They may be covered by snow or even glaciers. Some volcanoes are huge, gently sloping mountains. Many volcanoes are very small cones. Volcanic eruptions can come through cracks in the ground. Thin, fluid and runny lava forms gentle slopes. Thicker lavas build tall, steep volcanoes. Volcano types are discussed in this section. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Describe a composite volcano and how it forms. 2. Describe a shield volcano and how it forms. 3. Describe a cinder cone and how it forms. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows a cross section of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. At the top of the volcano is the volcanic crater. Below the surface of the earth lies the magma chamber. This is a large underground pool of magma or molten rock. When a volcano erupts, magma travels from the magma chamber up the conduit channel and exits the volcano through the volcanic crater and side vents. Ash, smoke and steam are other byproducts of volcanic eruptions.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows a simple cross section of a volcano. The bottom most part is the magma chamber, where the lava is stored. The lava flows out of the volcano through an opening called crater. The lava flows from the magma chamber to the crater through the main vent. During the flow, it also flows out through the secondary cone. The mountain like structure on the side are layers of ash and lava.</p>

        <p>The lava begins in the magma chamber. It makes its way up the main vent and comes out of the crater. Volcanic bombs, ash, and an ash cloud are by products of a volcanic eruption. Lava can also come out of a secondary cone by the secondary vent.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows a cross-section of a composite volcano revealing alternating layers of lava and ash. The volcano grows larger with each eruption as lava and ash are deposited onto its surface. The magma that flows from volcanoes comes from underneath the Earth's crust in a magma chamber. It is thick and travels slowly, creating the volcano's steep sides. There are frequently craters at the top from the last eruption. When the volcano erupts from the vent at the top, it spews large amounts of ash into the air creating an ash cloud. Sometime the magma is diverted from the main vent and find its way out of the side of the volcano, creating a secondary vent. Over time, the If the magma remains trapped, it creates a sill.</p>
