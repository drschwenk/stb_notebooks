        <h3>Earth Orbits a Star</h3>
        <p>Certainly no one today doubts that Earth orbits a star, the Sun. Photos taken from space, observations made by astronauts, and the fact that there has been so much successful space exploration that depends on understanding the structure of the solar system all confirm it. But in the early 17th century saying that Earth orbited the Sun rather than the reverse could get you tried for heresy, as it did Galileo. Lets explore the evolution of the idea that Earth orbits the Sun. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Geocentric Universe</h3>
        <p>To an observer, Earth appears to be the center of the universe. That is what the ancient Greeks believed. This view is called the geocentric model, or "Earth-centered" model, of the universe. In the geocentric model, the sky, or heavens, are a set of spheres layered on top of one another. Each object in the sky is attached to a sphere and moves around Earth as that sphere rotates. From Earth outward, these spheres contain the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. An outer sphere holds all the stars. Since the planets appear to move much faster than the stars, the Greeks placed them closer to Earth. The geocentric model explained why all the stars appear to rotate around Earth once per day. The model also explained why the planets move differently from the stars and from each other. One problem with the geocentric model is that some planets seem to move backwards (in retrograde) instead of in their usual forward motion around Earth. Around 150 A.D. the astronomer Ptolemy resolved this problem by using a system of circles to describe the motion of planets (Figure 1.1). In Ptolemys system, a planet moves in a small circle, called an epicycle. This circle moves around Earth in a larger circle, called a deferent. Ptolemys version of the geocentric model worked so well that it remained the accepted model of the universe for more than a thousand years. </p>

        <h3>The Heliocentric Universe</h3>
        <p>Ptolemys geocentric model worked, but it was complicated and occasionally made errors in predicting the movement of planets. At the beginning of the 16th century A.D., Nicolaus Copernicus proposed that Earth and all the other planets orbit the Sun. With the Sun at the center, this model is called the heliocentric model, or "sun-centered" model. Although Copernicus model was simpler - it didnt need epicycles and deferents - it still did not perfectly describe the motion of the planets. Johannes Kepler solved the problem a short time later when he determined that the planets moved around the Sun in ellipses (ovals), not circles (Figure 1.2). Keplers model matched observations perfectly. The heliocentric model did not catch on right away. When Galileo Galilei first turned a telescope to the heavens in 1610, he made several striking discoveries. Galileo discovered that the planet Jupiter has moons orbiting around it. This provided the first evidence that objects could orbit something besides Earth. Galileo also discovered that Venus has phases like the Moon (Figure 1.3), which provides direct evidence that Venus orbits the Sun. Galileos discoveries caused many more people to accept the heliocentric model of the universe, although Galileo himself was found guilty of heresy. The shift from an Earth-centered view to a Sun-centered view of the universe is referred to as the Copernican Revolution. In their elliptical orbits, each planet is sometimes farther away from the Sun than at other times. This movement is called revolution. At the same time, Earth spins on its axis. Earths axis is an imaginary line passing through the Keplers model showed the planets moving around the Sun in ellipses. The phases of Venus. planets center that goes through both the North Pole and the South Pole. This spinning movement is called Earths rotation. </p>

        <h3>Earths Revolution</h3>
        <p>Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler were all right: Earth and the other planets travel in an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The gravitational pull of the Sun keeps the planets in orbit. This ellipse is barely elliptical; its very close to being a circle. The closest Earth gets to the Sun each year is at perihelion (147 million km) on about January 3rd, and the furthest is at aphelion (152 million km) on July 4th. The shape of Earths orbit has nothing to do with Earths seasons. Earth and the other planets in the solar system make elliptical orbits around the Sun. For Earth to make one complete revolution around the Sun takes 365.24 days. This amount of time is the definition of one year. Earth has one large moon, which orbits Earth once every 29.5 days, a period known as a month. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In the geocentric model of the universe, Earth is at the center. In the heliocentric model of the universe, the Sun is at the center. The heliocentric model is the modern view of the solar system, but not the entire universe. Earth and the other planets of the solar system revolve around the Sun. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. How does the heliocentric model differ from the geocentric model? 2. Why do you think people had a hard time switching from one worldview to the other? 3. Describe Earths orbit around the Sun. </p>

        <p>This Diagram shows the Earth's rotation. Which is the amount of time that it takes to rotate once on its axis. This is, apparently, accomplished once a day every 24 hours. However, there are actually two different kinds of rotation that need to be considered here. For one, there's the amount of time it takes for the Earth to turn once on its axis so that it returns to the same orientation compared to the rest of the Universe. Then there's how long it takes for the Earth to turn so that the Sun returns to the same spot in the sky. Earth's rotation is slowing slightly with time; thus, a day was shorter in the past. This is due to the tidal effects the Moon has on Earth's rotation. Atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7 milliseconds than a century ago, slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows different imaginary lines around the earth. At the very north is the north pole and at the very south is the south pole of the earth. An imaginary line around the earth near the north pole is the arctic circle. It is located at 66.5 north of equator. An imaginary line around the earth near the south pole is the Antarctic circle. It is located at 66.5 south of equator. Equator is an imaginary line that goes round the Earth and divides it into two halves. The northern half is called northern hemisphere and the southern half is called southern hemisphere. Tropic of cancer and tropic of Capricorn are the two imaginary lines around the Earth on either side of the equator. The Tropic of Cancer is 23 26 north of it and the Tropic of Capricorn is 23 26 south of it.</p>
