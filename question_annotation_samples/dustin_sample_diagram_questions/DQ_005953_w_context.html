        <h3>Components of the Skeletal System</h3>
        <p>Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. In adults, the skeleton consists of a whopping 206 bones, many of them in the hands and feet. You can see many of the bones of the human skeleton in Figure 16.10. The skeletal system also includes cartilage and ligaments. Cartilage is a tough, flexible connective tissue that contains the protein collagen. It covers the ends of bones where they meet. The gray tissue in Figure 16.10 is cartilage. A ligament is a band of fibrous connective tissue. Ligaments connect bones of the skeleton and hold them together. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Functions of the Skeletal System</h3>
        <p>Your skeletal system supports your body and gives it shape. What else does it do? The skeletal system makes blood cells. Most blood cells are produced inside certain types of bones. The skeletal system stores calcium and helps maintain normal levels of calcium in the blood. Bones take up and store calcium when blood levels of calcium are high. They release some of the stored calcium when blood levels of calcium are low. The skeletal system works with muscles to move the body. Try to walk without bending your knees and youll see how important the skeletal system is for movement. The skeletal system protects the soft organs of the body. For example, the skull surrounds and protects the brain. The ribs protect the heart and lungs. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Bones</h3>
        <p>Some people think bones are like chalk: dead, dry, and brittle. In reality, bones are very much alive. They consist of living tissues and are supplied with blood and nerves. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Bone Structure</h3>
        <p>Bones are organs. Like other organs, they are made up of more than one kind of tissue. There are four different kinds of tissues in bones, as shown in Figure 16.11. From the outside of the bone to the center, the tissues are periosteum, compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Periosteum is a tough, fibrous membrane that covers and protects the outer surfaces of bone. Compact bone lies below periosteum. It is very dense and hard. Compact bone gives bones their strength. Spongy bone lies below compact bone. It is less dense than compact bone. Spongy bone contains many tiny holes, or pores, which provide spaces for blood vessels and bone marrow. Bone marrow is a soft connective tissue inside pores and cavities in spongy bone. Bone marrow makes blood cells. </p>

        <h3>How Bones Grow and Develop</h3>
        <p>Early in the development of a human fetus, the skeleton is made entirely of cartilage. The relatively soft cartilage gradually changes to hard bone through ossification. This is a process in which mineral deposits replace cartilage in bone. At birth, several areas of cartilage remain, including the ends of the long bones in the arms and legs. This allows these bones to keep growing in length during childhood. By the late teens or early twenties, all of the cartilage has been replaced by bone. Bones cannot grow in length after this point has been reached. However, bones can continue to grow in width. They are stimulated to grow thicker when they are put under stress by muscles. Weight-bearing activities such as weight lifting can increase growth in bone width. </p>

        <h3>Joints</h3>
        <p>A joint is a place where two or more bones of the skeleton meet. There are three different types of joints based on the degree to which they allow movement of the bones: immovable, partly movable, and movable joints. Immovable joints do not allow the bones to move at all. In these joints, the bones are fused together by very tough collagen. Examples of immovable joints include the joints between bones of the skull. You can see them in Figure 16.12. Partly movable joints allow very limited movement. In these joints, the bones are held together by cartilage, which is more flexible than collagen. Examples of partly moveable joints include the bones of the rib cage. Movable joints allow the greatest movement and are the most common. In these joints, the bones are connected by ligaments. The surfaces of the bones at the joints are covered with a smooth layer of cartilage. It reduces friction between the bones when they move. The space between the bones is also filled with a liquid called synovial fluid. It helps to cushion the bones. There are several different types of movable joints. You can see three of them in Figure 16.13. Move these three joints in your own skeleton to experience the range of motion each allows. </p>

        <h3>Skeletal System Problems and How to Prevent Them</h3>
        <p>What you eat as a teen can affect how healthy your skeletal system is not only now but also in the future. Eating a diet with plenty of calcium and vitamin D can help keep your bones strong. If you dont get enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet as a teen, you will be more likely to develop osteoporosis when you are older. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Osteoporosis</h3>
        <p>Osteoporosis is a disease in which the bones become porous and weak because they do not contain enough calcium. The graph in Figure 16.14 shows how the mass of calcium in bone peaks around age 30 and declines after that, especially in women. Maximizing the calcium in your bones while youre young will reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis later in of life. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Fractures</h3>
        <p>People with osteoporosis have an increased risk of bone fractures. A bone fracture is a crack or break in bone. Even if you have healthy bones, you may fracture a bone if too much stress is placed on it. This could happen in a car crash or while playing a sport. Wearing a seatbelt when you ride in a motor vehicle and wearing safety gear when you play sports may help prevent bone fractures. Bone fractures heal naturally as new bone tissue forms at the site of the fracture. However, the bone may have to be placed in a cast or have rods or screws inserted into it to keep it correctly aligned until it heals. The healing process usually takes several weeks or even months. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Sprains</h3>
        <p>Another type of skeletal system injury is a sprain. A sprain is a strain or tear in a ligament that has been twisted or stretched too far. Ankle sprains are a common type of sprain. Athletes often strain a ligament in the knee called the ACL. Warming up adequately and stretching before playing sports may reduce the risk of a sprain. Ligament injuries can take a long time to heal. Rest, ice, compression, and elevation of the sprained area may help the healing process. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Identify components of the skeletal system.
List functions of the skeletal system.
Describe the structure of bone, and explain how bones grow and develop.
Describe different types of joints, and explain how they function.
Identify skeletal system problems and ways to prevent them.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. The skeletal system also includes cartilage and ligaments. Functions of the skeletal system include supporting and shaping the body, allowing movement, producing blood cells, and storing calcium. Bones consist of four different types of tissue: periosteum, compact bone, spongy bone, and bone marrow. Ossification gradually changes the cartilage skeleton of the fetus to the bony skeleton of the adult. Joints may be immovable, partly movable, or movable. Types of movable joints include ball-and-socket, hinge, and pivot joints. Skeletal system problems include osteoporosis, bone fractures, and ligament sprains. A diet rick in calcium and vitamin D may reduce the risk of osteoporosis and related bone fractures. Following safe practices may also reduce the risk of fractures as well as sprains. </p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the human skeleton. The axial skeleton includes the skull, vertebral column, and thoracic cage. The skull consists of 28 bones: 8 cranial vault bones, 14 facial bones, and 6 auditory ossicles. From a lateral view, the parietal, temporal, and sphenoid bones can be seen. From a frontal view, the orbits and nasal cavity can be seen, as well as associated bones and structures, such as the frontal bone, zygomatic bone, maxilla, and mandible. The interior of the cranial vault contains three fossae with several foramina. Seen from below, the base of the skull reveals numerous foramina and other structures, such as processes for muscle attachment. The vertebral column contains 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, and 5 lumbar vertebrae, plus 1 sacral and 1 coccygeal bone. Each vertebra consists of a body, an arch, and processes. Regional differences in vertebrae are as follows: cervical vertebrae have transverse foramina; thoracic vertebrae have long spinous processes and attachment sites for the ribs; lumbar vertebrae have rectangular transverse and spinous processes, and the position of their facets limit rotation; the sacrum is a single, fused bone; the coccyx is four or fewer fused vertebrae. The thoracic cage consists of thoracic vertebrae, ribs, and sternum. There are 12 pairs of ribs: 7 true and 5 false (two of the false ribs are also called floating ribs). The sternum consists of the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The appendicular skeleton consists of the bones of the upper and lower limbs and their girdles. The pectoral girdle includes the scapula and clavicle. The upper limb consists of the arm (humerus), forearm (ulna and radius), wrist (eight carpal bones), and hand (five metacarpals, three phalanges in each finger, and two phalanges in the thumb). The pelvic girdle is made up of the sacrum and two coxae. Each coxa consists of an ilium, ischium, and pubis. The lower limb includes the thigh (femur), leg (tibia and fibula), ankle (seven tarsals), and foot (metatarsals and phalanges, similar to the bones in the hand).</p>

        <p>The image below shows the Human Skeleton. The human skeleton is the internal framework of the body. It is composed of around 300 bones at birth, this total decreases to 206 bones by adulthood after some bones have fused together. The human skeleton performs six major functions; support, movement, protection, production of blood cells, storage of minerals and endocrine regulation. Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. Some people think bones are like chalk: dead, dry, and brittle. In reality, bones are very much alive. They consist of living tissues and are supplied with blood and nerves.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows some major bones of the human skeletal system. There are 206 bones in a normal human body. The hands and feet contain many those bones--the hand bones are called carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges. The foot bones are called tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges. The skeletal system has several functions for humans. It gives the body structure and shape. It gives protection to vital organs--for example the skull protects the brain and the ribcage protects the heart and lungs. It helps with movement--muscles attach to the bones and together they help us move. The final function is blood production. Red and white blood cells are made in the bone marrow of the long bones.</p>
