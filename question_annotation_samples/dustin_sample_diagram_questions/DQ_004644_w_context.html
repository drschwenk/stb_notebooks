        <h3>The First Plants</h3>
        <p>The first plants were probably similar to the stoneworts in Figure 10.11. Stoneworts are green algae. Like stoneworts, the first plants were aquatic. They may have had stalks but not stems. They also may have had hair-like structures called rhizoids but not roots. The first plants probably had male and female reproductive organs and needed water to reproduce. In stoneworts, sperm need at least a thin film of moisture to swim to eggs. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>Colonizing the Land</h3>
        <p>By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant living things in the water. Plants were also limited to the upper layer of water. Only near the top of the water column is there enough sunlight for photosynthesis. So plants never became dominant aquatic organisms. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Moving From Water to Land</h3>
        <p>All that changed when plants moved from water to land. This may have happened by 500 million years ago or even earlier. On land, everything was wide open. There were no other living things. Without plants, there was nothing for other organisms to eat. Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established. The earliest land plants may have resembled the modern liverworts in Figure 10.12. </p>
        
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Life Is Hard Without Water</h3>
        <p>Moving to the land was a huge step in plant evolution. Until then, virtually all life had evolved in water. Dry land was a very different kind of place. The biggest problem was the dryness. Simply absorbing enough water to stay alive was a huge challenge. It kept early plants small and low to the ground. Water was also needed for sexual reproduction, so sperm could swim to eggs. There were other hardships on land besides dryness. For example, sunlight on land was strong and dangerous. Solar radiation put land organisms at high risk of mutations. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Evolution of Vascular Plants</h3>
        <p>After they left the water, plants evolved adaptations that helped them withstand the harsh conditions on land. One of the earliest and most important adaptations to evolve was vascular tissue. For a fast-paced introduction to vascular plants and their successes, watch this video:  .

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Evolution of Vascular Tissues</h3>
        <p>Vascular tissue forms a plants "plumbing system." It carries water and dissolved minerals from the soil to all the other cells of the plant. It also carries food (sugar dissolved in water) from photosynthetic cells to other cells in the plant for growth or storage. The evolution of vascular tissue revolutionized the plant kingdom. Vascular tissue greatly improved the ability of plants to absorb and transfer water. This allowed plants to grow larger and taller. They could also liver in drier habitats and survive periods of drought. Early vascular plants probably resembled the fern in Figure 10.13. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Other Adaptations in Vascular Plants</h3>
        <p>Other early adaptations to life on land included the evolution of true leaves and roots. Leaves allowed plants to take better advantage of sunlight for photosynthesis. Roots helped plants absorb water and minerals from soil. Early land plants also evolved a dominant sporophyte generation. Sporophytes are diploid, so they have two copies of each gene. This gives them a "back-up" copy in case of mutation. This was important for coping with the strong solar radiation and higher risk of mutations on land. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Success of Vascular Plants</h3>
        <p>With all these adaptations, its easy to see why vascular plants were very successful. They spread quickly and widely on land. As vascular plants spread, many nonvascular plants went extinct. Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 10.13 Modern ferns are similar to early vascular plants. The yellow structures on this fern are sporangia. They produce spores for reproduction.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Evolution of Seed Plants</h3>
        <p>Early vascular plants still needed moisture. They needed it in order to reproduce. Sperm had to swim from male to female reproductive organs for fertilization. Even spores needed some water to grow and often to disperse as well. In addition, dryness and other harsh conditions made it very difficult for tiny new offspring plants to survive. With the evolution of seeds in vascular plants, all that changed. Seed plants evolved a number of adaptations that made it possible to reproduce without water. Seeds also nourished and protected tiny new offspring. As a result, seed plants were wildly successful. They exploded into virtually all of Earths habitats. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Why Seeds Are Adaptive on Land</h3>
        <p>A seed is a reproductive structure that contains an embryo and a food supply, called endosperm. Both the embryo and endosperm are enclosed within a tough outer coating, called a hull (or shell). You can see these parts of a seed in Figure 10.14. An embryo is a zygote that has already started to develop and grow. Early growth and development of a plant embryo inside a seed is called germination. The seed protects and nourishes the embryo and gives it a huge head start in the "race" of life. Both a parent plant and its offspring are better off if they dont grow too closely together. That way, they will not need to compete for resources. Many seeds have structures that help them travel away from the parent plant. You can see some examples in Figure 10.15. Some seeds can also wait to germinate until conditions are favorable for growth. This increases the offsprings chances of surviving even more. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Other Reproductive Adaptations in Seed Plants</h3>
        <p>Seed plants also evolved other reproductive structures. These included ovules, pollen, and pollen tubes. An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants. It contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed. Pollen is a tiny male gametophyte enclosed in a tough capsule. Pollen carries sperm to an ovule while preventing the sperm from drying out. Pollen grains cant swim, but they are very light, so the wind can carry them. Therefore, they can travel through air instead of water. Pollen also evolved the ability to grow a tube, called a pollen tube. Sperm could be transferred through the tube directly from the pollen grain to the egg. This allowed sperm to reach an egg without swimming through a film of water. It finally freed plants from depending on moisture to reproduce. </p>

        <h3>Early Seed Plants</h3>
        <p>The first seed plants formed seeds in cones, like the cone in Figure 10.16. Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales. Scales are modified leaves. Male cones contain pollen. Female cones contain eggs. They are also where seeds develop. The seeds in cones are "naked." They arent protected inside an ovary, which was a later adaptation of seed plants. </p>

        <h3>Evolution of Flowering Plants</h3>
        <p>Some seed plants evolved another major adaptation. This was the formation of seeds in flowers. Flowers are plant structures that contain male and/or female reproductive organs. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Parts of a Flower</h3>
        <p>You can see the parts of a typical flower in Figure 10.17. The male reproductive organ in a flower is the stamen. It has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther is where pollen forms. The female reproductive organ in a flower is the pistil. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is the top of the pistil. It is sticky to help it "catch" pollen. The style connects the stigma to the ovary. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit. The fruit protects the seeds. It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds. Petals are usually the most visible parts of a flower. They may be large and showy and are often brightly colored. Leaf-like green sepals protect the flower while it is still a bud. </p>

        <h3>Pollinators</h3>
        <p>The showy petals of flowers evolved to help attract pollinators. Wind-blown pollen might land just anywhere and be wasted. A pollinator is an animal that picks up pollen on its body and carries it directly to another flower of the same species. This helps ensure that pollination occurs. Pollinators are usually small animals such as bees, butterflies, and bats. You can see an example in Figure 10.18. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Classification of Modern Plants</h3>
        <p>The most basic division of modern plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nonvascular Plants</h3>
        <p>Modern nonvascular plants are called bryophytes. There are about 17,000 bryophyte species. They include liver- worts, hornworts, and mosses. Mosses are the most numerous group of bryophytes. You can see an example of moss in Figure 10.19. Like the moss in the figure, most bryophytes are small. They lack not only vascular tissues. They also lack true roots, leaves, seeds, and flowers. Bryophytes live in moist habitats. Without the adaptations of vascular plants, bryophytes are not very good at absorbing water. They also need water to reproduce. </p>

        <h3>Vascular Plants</h3>
        <p>Todays vascular plants are called tracheophytes. Their vascular tissue is specialized to transport fluid. This allows them to grow tall and take advantage of sunlight high up in the air. It also allows them to live in drier habitats. Most modern plants are tracheophytes. There are hundreds of thousands of species of them. Seedless vascular plants include plants such as ferns. You can see a fern in Figure 10.20. Ferns reproduce with spores instead of seeds. The black dots on the back of the fern leaf in Figure 10.20 are spores. </p>

        <h3>Seed Plants</h3>
        <p>Seed plants are vascular plants that reproduce with seeds. Modern seed plants are called spermatophytes. Seeds allow the plants to reproduce without water. Most vascular plants today are seed plants. Modern seed plants include gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms are seed plants that produce naked seeds in cones. There are about 1000 species of gym- nosperms. Conifers are the most common group of gymnosperms. The spruce tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a conifer. Angiosperms are seed plants that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers. Today, they are by far the most diverse type of seed plants. In fact, the vast majority of all modern plants are angiosperms. There are hundreds of thousands of species of them. The apple tree in Figure 10.21 is an example of a common angiosperm. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The first plants probably evolved from aquatic green algae. They had male and female reproductive organs. However, they lacked true stems, roots, and leaves. Plants were the first living things to move from water to land. They had to cope with dryness and strong solar radiation. The first major adaptation that evolved in land plants was vascular tissue. This type of tissue helped land plants cope with dryness. Vascular plants also evolved true stems, roots, and leaves. Some vascular plants evolved seeds. This freed them from needing water to reproduce. Early seed plants produced naked seeds in cones. Some seed plants evolved flowers for the production of seeds. Flowers contain both male and female repro- ductive organs, including an ovary where eggs form and seeds develop. Flowers also attract pollinators. The most basic division of modern plants is between nonvascular and vascular plants. Vascular plants are further divided into those that reproduce without seeds and those that reproduce with seeds. Seed plants, in turn, are divided into those that produce naked seeds in cones (gymnosperms) and those that produce seeds in the ovaries of flowers (angiosperms). </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Plants cant move away from danger. 1. Does this mean that plants are helpless? 2. How might plants be able to protect themselves from pathogens? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The first plants lived in water. As shown in Figure 10.10, plants are thought to have evolved from aquatic green algae. Plants were the first organisms to move from water to land. They evolved important adaptations for life out of water. These adaptations included vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Each of these major adaptations made plants better suited for dry land and much more successful. For a good introduction to the origin and diversity of plants, watch this short video:  .

        <p>This diagram shows the various parts of a flower. The flower shown in the diagram has large bright pink petals. It has two green colored sepals at the bottom. The sepals protect the flower when it is still a bud. The male reproductive part is called a stamen. Stamen has an anther on the top and a long stalk-like filament at the bottom. The female reproductive part known as the pistil is at the center of the flower and it consists of the stigma, style and ovary. The stigma is the top of the pistil. It is sticky to help it catch pollen. The style connects the stigma to the ovary. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. The ovules are present inside the ovary. The ovules develop into seeds after fertilization. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit.</p>

        <p>Below is a diagram of a basic flower. Usually, the petals are on the outside of the flower and the most visible. Inside, the stamen has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther is where pollen forms. The female reproductive organ in a flower is the pistil. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit. The fruit protects the seeds. It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the different parts of a flower. The male reproductive organ in a flower is the stamen. It has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther is where pollen forms. Pollen is powdery grains that contain the male reproductive cells the plant. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit. Petals are usually the most visible parts of a flower. They may be large and showy and are often brightly colored. Together, all the petals of a flower are called a corolla. Leaf-like green sepals protect the flower while it is still a bud. Collectively the sepals are called the calyx which is the outermost whorl of parts that form a flower.</p>

        <p>The diagram highlights the key features of a bean seed. A seed is an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. Bean seeds are dicot seeds as they have two cotyledons in its seed and can be split in half lengthwise into the two cotyledons. A seed coat protects the internal parts of the seed from fungi, bacteria and insects and prevents water loss. The main components of the embryo are the cotyledons, epicotyl, hypocotyl and the radicle. The cotyledons refer to the seed leaves which are attached to the embryonic axis. The epicotyl refers to the embryonic axis above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s). The hypocotyl refers to the embryonic axis below the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s), connecting the epicotyl and the radicle, being the stem-root transition zone. The radicle which refers to the basal tip of the hypocotyl, grows into the primary root.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the internal structure of a corn kernel or corn seed. The seed has three main parts seed coat, endosperm and the embryo. The seed coat is the outermost part of the seed and it protects both the endosperm and the embryo. The endosperm is below the seed coat. It stores food in the seed. The embryo is what gives rise to a new plant. Early growth and development of a plant embryo inside a seed is called germination. The embryo consists of the embryonic leaves, cotyledon and the primary root.</p>
