        <h3>Reflected Light and Images</h3>
        <p>Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. Light reflects off surfaces such as mirrors that do not transmit or absorb light. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected (or refracted) light. Q: Is an image an actual object? If not, what is it? A: No, an image isnt an actual object. It is focused rays of light that make a copy of an object, like a picture projected on a screen. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Regular and Diffuse Reflection</h3>
        <p>If a surface is extremely smooth, as it is in a mirror, then the image formed by reflection is sharp and clear. This is called regular reflection (also called specular reflection). However, if the surface is even slightly rough or bumpy, an image may not form, or if there is an image, it is blurry or fuzzy. This is called diffuse reflection. Q: Look at the boats and their images in the Figure 1.1. Which one represents regular reflection, and which one represents diffuse reflection? A: Reflection of the boat on the left is regular reflection. The water is smooth and the image is sharp and clear. Reflection of the boat on the right is diffuse reflection. The water has ripples and the image is blurry and wavy. In the Figure 1.2, you can see how both types of reflection occur. Waves of light are represented by arrows called rays. Rays that strike the surface are referred to as incident rays, and rays that reflect off the surface are known as reflected rays. In regular reflection, all the rays are reflected in the same direction. This explains why regular reflection forms a clear image. In diffuse reflection, the rays are reflected in many different directions. This is why diffuse reflection forms, at best, a blurry image. </p>

        <h3>Law of Reflection</h3>
        <p>One thing is true of both regular and diffuse reflection. The angle at which the reflected rays leave the surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. This is known as the law of reflection. The law is illustrated in the Figure 1.3. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Reflection is one of several ways that light can interact with matter. When light is reflected from a smooth surface, it may form an image. An image is a copy of an object that is formed by reflected (or refracted) light. According to the law of reflection, the an- gle of reflection always equals the angle of incidence. The angles of both reflected and incident light are measured relative to an imaginary line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the reflective surface. Regular reflection occurs when light reflects off a very smooth surface and forms a clear image. Diffuse reflection occurs when light reflects off a rough surface and forms a blurry image or no image at all. According to the law of reflection, the angle at which light rays reflect off a surface is equal to the angle at which the incident rays strike the surface. </p>

        <p>1. What is an image? 2. Identify the object and the image in the Figure 1.4. Which type of reflection formed the image: regular reflection or diffuse reflection? How do you know? 3. What is the law of reflection? 4. Label the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection in the Figure 1.5. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows Ray (optics). In optics, a ray is an idealized model of light, obtained by choosing a line that is perpendicular to the wave fronts of the actual light, and that points in the direction of energy flow. Rays are used to model the propagation of light through an optical system by dividing the real light field up into discrete rays that can be computationally propagated through the system by the techniques of ray tracing. This allows even very complex optical systems to be analyzed mathematically or simulated by computer. All three rays should meet at the same point. The Principal Ray or Chief Ray (sometimes known as the b ray) in an optical system is the meridional ray that starts at the edge of the object and passes through the center of the aperture stop. This ray crosses the optical axis at the locations of the pupils. As such, chief rays are equivalent to the rays in a pinhole camera. The Central Ray is perpendicular to Infrared Radiation. The third one, called the Focal Ray, is a mirror image of the parallel ray. The focal ray is drawn from the tip of the object through (or towards) the focal point, reflecting off the mirror parallel to the principal axis.</p>

        <p>The reflection of a tree shines in to the lake. When the human eye sees the reflection from the tree on the water it looks the right direction. The image of the tree is upside down. The water reflection on the lake makes things upright to the human eye.</p>

        <p>This diagram explains the law of reflection and shows how light gets reflected from a surface. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence (i) is always equal to the angle of reflection (r). The angles of both reflected and incident ray are measured relative to the imaginary dotted-line, called normal, that is perpendicular (at right angles) to the mirror (reflective surface).</p>

        <p>This diagram depicts how light rays can reflect off various surfaces. Incident rays will reflect back at a specific angle if the surface is smooth. A rough or broken surface will have reflected rays with a wide variety of reflected angles. The left part of the diagram shows why your reflection in a mirror is smooth and natural looking.</p>
