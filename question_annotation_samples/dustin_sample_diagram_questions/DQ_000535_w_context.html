        <h3>What Is Climate</h3>
        <p>Climate is the average weather of a place over many years. It includes average temperatures. It also includes average precipitation. The timing of precipitation is part of climate as well. What determines the climate of a place? Latitude is the main factor. A nearby ocean or mountain range can also play a role. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Latitude and Climate</h3>
        <p>Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator. Its measured in degrees, from 0 to 90 . Several climate factors vary with latitude. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Latitude and Temperature</h3>
        <p>Temperature changes with latitude. You can see how in Figure 17.2 At the equator, the Suns rays are most direct. Temperatures are highest. At higher latitudes, the Suns rays are less direct. The farther an area is from the equator, the lower is its temperature. At the poles, the Suns rays are least direct. Much of the area is covered with ice and snow, which reflect a lot of sunlight. Temperatures are lowest here. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Latitude and Precipitation</h3>
        <p>Global air currents affect precipitation. How they affect it varies with latitude. You can see why in Figure 17.3. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Latitude and Prevailing Winds</h3>
        <p>Global air currents cause global winds. Figure 17.4 shows the direction that these winds blow. Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move air masses, which causes weather. The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean. An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range. Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate. What if the prevailing winds are westerlies? What would the climate be like? </p>

        <h3>Oceans and Climate</h3>
        <p>When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Coastal and Inland Climates</h3>
        <p>Even places at the same latitude may have different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland. On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean. A coastal climate is usually mild. Summers arent too hot, and winters arent too cold. Precipitation can be high due to the moisture in the air. Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land. This air may be dry because it comes from over land. An inland climate is usually more extreme. Winters may be very cold, and summers may be very hot. Precipitation can be low. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ocean Currents and Climate</h3>
        <p>Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the worlds oceans. They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans. This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world. Currents that are near shore have a direct impact on climate. They may make the climate much colder or warmer. You can see examples of this in Figure 17.5. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mountains and Climate</h3>
        <p>Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain? Did you notice that it was cooler near the top? Climate is not just different on a mountain. Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Altitude and Temperature</h3>
        <p>Air temperature falls at higher altitudes. You can see this in Figure 17.6. Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat. Look at the mountain in Figure 17.7. The peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Africa, 3 south latitude) is 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level. At 3 S its very close to the equator. At the bottom of the mountain, the temperature is high year round. How can you tell that its much cooler at the top? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mountains and Precipitation</h3>
        <p>Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up a mountain range the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range the air is dry and it sinks. So there is very little precipitation on the far (leeward) side of a mountain range. Figure 17.8 shows how this happens. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>6. An ocean current flows from north to south off the western coast of a continent. The current flows close to land at 50 N latitude. Predict how the current affects the climate of the coast at that latitude. Explain your prediction. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Define climate.
State how climate is related to latitude.
Explain how oceans influence climate.
Describe how mountains affect climate.
</p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Climate is the average weather of a place over many years. It varies with latitude. It may also be influenced by nearby oceans or mountains. Temperature falls from the equator to the poles. Global air currents create wet and dry zones at different latitudes. They also create global winds. Oceans influence the climate of coasts. A coastal climate is mild. It may also get plenty of rain. An inland climate has greater temperature extremes. It can also be dry. The air is cooler as you go higher up a mountain. Mountain ranges can also cast rain shadows. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>One winter day in Chicago, the temperature hit 20 C (68 F). This would be normal for Miami in the winter, but in Chicago, it felt like a heat wave. The scene in Figure 17.1 is more typical for Chicago in the winter. The heat wave on that winter day is an example of weather. The typical temperature for that day is part of Chicagos climate. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the effect of rains on hills. The moist air from the green side of the hills rising up in the air and condenses as water vapor. This is called precipitation. The other side of the hill from the rain shadow region. Rain shadow region is a region having little rainfall because it is sheltered from prevailing rain-bearing winds by a range of hills. The dry air descends from this region.</p>

        <p>The diagram is a representation of how a rain shadow is formed. A rain shadow is a dry region of land on the side of a mountain range that is protected from the prevailing winds. Prevailing winds are the winds that occur most of the time in a particular location on the Earth. The protected side of a mountain range is also called the lee side or the down-wind side. Prevailing winds carry air toward the mountain range. As the air rises up over a mountain range, the air cools, water vapor condenses, and clouds form. On this side of the mountains, called the windward side, precipitation falls in the form of rain or snow. The windward side of a mountain range is moist and lush because of this precipitation. Once the air passes over the mountain range, it moves down the other side, warms, and dries out. This dry air produces a rain shadow. Land in a rain shadow is typically very dry and receives much less precipitation and cloud cover than land on the windward side of the mountain range.</p>
