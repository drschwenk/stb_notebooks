        <h3>Groundwater</h3>
        <p>Freshwater below Earths surface is called groundwater. The water infiltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from the surface. How does this happen? And where does the water go? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Porous and Impermeable Rock</h3>
        <p>Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock are porous. Between the grains are pores, or tiny holes. Since water can move through this rock it is permeable. Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is not porous and so is impermeable. Water stops moving downward when it reaches this layer of rock. Look at the diagram in Figure 13.11. It shows two layers of porous rock. The top layer is not saturated; it is not full of water. The next layer is saturated. The water in this layer has nowhere else to go. It cannot seep any deeper into the ground because the rock below it is impermeable. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p><img src="../../textbook_images/groundwater_20095.png" width=500px></p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 13.11 Water seeps into the ground through permeable material and stops when it reaches an impermeable rock. Predict the purpose of the well in the diagram.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Water Table</h3>
        <p>The top of the saturated rock layer in Figure 13.11 is called the water table. The water table isnt like a real table. It doesnt remain firmly in one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain and lower when the weather is dry. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Aquifer</h3>
        <p>An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer. A diagram of an aquifer is shown in Figure 13.12. Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone. Water infiltrates the aquifer from the surface. The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Human Use of Aquifers</h3>
        <p>Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by people for freshwater. The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water. An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its water is removed. The water table may lower and the aquifer may even run dry. If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is likely to damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Ogallala Aquifer</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer. As you can see from Figure 13.13, this aquifer lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states. It covers a total area of 451,000 square kilometers (174,000 square miles). In some places, it is less than a meter deep. In other places, it is hundreds of meters deep. The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the American Midwest. This is a major farming area, and much of the water is used to irrigate crops. The water in this aquifer is being used up ten times faster than it is recharged. If this continues, what might happen to the Ogallala aquifer? </p>
        
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Springs and Geysers</h3>
        <p>The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the surface of the ground. This often happens on a slope. The water flows out of the ground and creates a spring. A spring may be just a tiny trickle, or it may be a big gush of water. One of the largest springs in the world is Big Spring in Missouri, seen in Figure 13.14. Water flowing out of the ground at a spring may flow downhill and enter a stream. Thats what happens to the water that flows out of Big Spring in Missouri. If the water from a spring cant flow downhill, it may spread out to form a pond or lake instead. Lake George in New York State, which is pictured in Figure 13.15, is a spring-fed lake. The lake basin was carved by a glacier. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Mineral Springs and Hot Springs</h3>
        <p>Some springs have water that contains minerals. Groundwater dissolves minerals out of the rock as it seeps through the pores. The water in some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma. Many hot springs are also mineral springs. Thats because hot water can dissolve more minerals than cold water. Grand Prismatic Spring, shown in Figure 13.16, is a hot mineral spring. Dissolved minerals give its water a bright blue color. The edge of the spring is covered with thick orange mats of bacteria. The bacteria use the minerals in the hot water to make food. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Geysers</h3>
        <p>Heated groundwater may become trapped in spaces within rocks. Pressure builds up as more water seeps into the spaces. When the pressure becomes great enough, the water bursts out of the ground at a crack or weak spot. This is called a geyser. When the water erupts from the ground, the pressure is released. Then more water collects and the pressure builds up again. This leads to another eruption. Old Faithful is the best-known geyser in the world. You can see a picture of it in Figure 13.17. The geyser erupts faithfully every 90 minutes, day after day. During each eruption, it may release as much as 30,000 liters of water! </p>

        <h3>Wells</h3>
        <p>Most groundwater does not flow out of an aquifer as a spring or geyser. So to use the water thats stored in an aquifer people must go after it. How? They dig a well. A well is a hole that is dug or drilled through the ground down to an aquifer. This is illustrated in Figure 13.18. People have depended on water from wells for thousands of years. To bring water to the surface takes energy because the force of gravity must be overcome. Today, many wells use electricity to pump water to the surface. However, in some places, water is still brought to the surface the old-fashioned way  with human labor. The well pictured in Figure 13.19 is an example of this type of well. A hand-cranked pulley is used to lift the bucket of water to the surface. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>6. Assume you live in a town that gets its water from an aquifer. The aquifer lies beneath the town. Apply lesson concepts to predict what may happen if water is pumped out of the aquifer faster than it is recharged. Then, write a letter to the editor of the towns newspaper. State what you think may happen. Argue for the need to use water wisely. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how water enters an aquifer.
Explain how water leaves an aquifer.
Define aquifer, and give an example.
Define springs and geysers.
State the purpose of wells and how they work.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Groundwater is freshwater below Earths surface. It seeps down from the surface through pores in soil and rock. It keeps seeping downward until it reaches a layer of impermeable rock. An aquifer is an underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater. One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer in the American Midwest. Water that flows out of the ground where an aquifer meets the surface is called a spring. Spring water may contain dissolved minerals. It may also be heated by magma in the crust. Heated groundwater that erupts from the ground under pressure is called a geyser. Many people get their freshwater from an aquifer. They obtain the water through a well. A well is a hole that is dug or drilled through the ground down to an aquifer. </p>

        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>7. Compare and contrast springs and geysers. 8. LaShawna and her family went to Yellowstone National Park. They saw a spring called Green Dragon Spring. Steam was rising off the water. When LaShawna saw the steam, she said that the water must contain a lot of minerals. Do you agree with LaShawnas statement? Why or why not? </p>

        <p>Freshwater is needed by many living things on Earth. However, most of Earths water is not fresh. Instead, it is salt water in the oceans. What do you know about Earths oceans? For example, how deep are they? And why is their water salty? Ocean water moves in waves, tides, and currents. Do you know what causes these ocean water movements? </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Rivers and lakes hold a lot of Earths liquid freshwater. However, far more is hidden from sight. Where is it? It is stored under the ground. In fact, 20 times more of Earths liquid freshwater is found below the surface than on the surface. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. Define groundwater. 2. Describe how water enters the ground. 3. What is the water table? What might cause it to rise or fall? 4. Define aquifer. Where does an aquifer get its water? 5. What is the purpose of a well? </p>

        <p>The picture shows the groundwater and how it moves. Rivers and lakes hold a lot of Earths liquid freshwater. Twenty times more of Earths liquid freshwater is found below the surface than on the surface. Groundwater (or ground water) is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposit is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. Groundwater is recharged from, and eventually flows to, the surface naturally. Natural discharge often occurs at springs and seeps, and can form oases or wetlands. Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology.</p>

        <p>This diagram depicts how the groundwater is formed. WIth the diagram, we can understand how the groundwater is formed. First, the water is poured down from the cloud to the earth's surface. The water is recharged to the top layer of the earth called piezometric surface. Below the piezometric surface, the layer containing water is called unconfined aquifer. The top level of the unconfined aquifer is called water table level. Under the unconfined aquifer, there is a layer that the water cannot penetrate. We call the layer as impermeable layer. Under the impermeable layer, a thick layer containing water is called confide aquifer. The earth region that supports the confined aquifer is called confining bed. The hole to obtain water in the unconfined aquifer is called artesian bore.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the structure of groundwater storage in the earth. The top layer of the earth is call unsaturated zone and does not have water stored. The below the unsaturated zone, there is an unconfined aquifer which contains the water closest to the earth surface. The boundary between the unsaturated zone and unconfined aquifer is called water table. The unconfined water layer absorbers the water from the surface and provide the water to the river or to the ground by a pump. The water circulation period in the unconfined aquifer is from days to years. Under the unconfined aquifer, there is a confining bed. Under the confining bed, there is confined aquifer. This is deeper layer than unconfined aquifer and the water returning cycle to the ground is century long. Under the confined aquifer, there is another confining bed. Below the confined aquifer, there is another confined aquifer. The water returning cycle to the ground is millennium long.</p>
