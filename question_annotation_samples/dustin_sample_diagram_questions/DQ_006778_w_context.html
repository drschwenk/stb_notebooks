        <h3>Parts of the Cardiovascular System</h3>
        <p>The organs that make up the cardiovascular system are the heart and a network of blood vessels that run throughout the body. The blood in the cardiovascular system is a liquid connective tissue. Figure 18.1 shows the heart and major vessels through which blood flows in the system. The heart is basically a pump that keeps blood moving through the blood vessels. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Functions of the Cardiovascular System</h3>
        <p>The main function of the cardiovascular system is transporting substances around the body. Figure 18.1 shows some of the substances that are transported in the blood. They include hormones, oxygen, nutrients from digested food, and cellular wastes. Transport of all these materials is necessary to maintain homeostasis of the body and life itself. The cardiovascular system also helps regulate body temperature by controlling where blood moves around the body. Blood is warm, so when more blood flows to the surface of the body, it warms the surface. This allows the body to lose excess heat from the surface. When less blood flows to the surface, it cools the surface. This allows the body to conserve heat and stay warm. You can see the role of blood vessels in the regulation of body temperature in this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Two Circulations</h3>
        <p>The heart and blood vessels form a closed system through which blood keeps circulating. However, blood actually circulates in two different loops within this closed system. The two loops are called pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. In both loops, blood passes through the heart. You can see a simple model of each circulation loop in Figure 18.2. As blood circulates through the body, it travels first through one loop and then the other loop, over and over again. </p>

        <h3>Pulmonary Circulation</h3>
        <p>Pulmonary circulation is the shorter loop of the cardiovascular system. It carries blood between the heart and lungs. Oxygen-poor blood flows from the heart to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Then the oxygen-rich blood returns to the heart. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Systemic Circulation</h3>
        <p>Systemic circulation is the longer loop of the cardiovascular system. It carries blood between the heart and the rest of the body. Oxygen-rich blood flows from the heart to cells throughout the body. As it passes cells, the blood releases oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide. Then the oxygen-poor blood returns to the heart. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>3. The cardiovascular system has been called the highway system of the body. Do you think this is a good analogy for the cardiovascular system? Why or why not? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Identify parts of the cardiovascular system.
State functions of the cardiovascular system.
Compare and contrast the two circulations of the cardiovascular system.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, a network of blood vessels, and blood. Blood is a liquid tissue. The heart is a pump that keeps blood flowing through the vessels of the system. The main function of the cardiovascular system is transport. It carries substances such as hormones, oxygen, nutrients, and cellular wastes around the body. The cardiovascular system also helps regulate body temperature by controlling blood flow. The cardiovascular system circulates blood through two different loops. Pulmonary circulation is a loop that carries blood between the heart and lungs. Systemic circulation is a loop that carries blood between the heart and the rest of the body. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The main organs of the cardiovascular system are the heart and blood vessels. Both organs contain valves. Valves also are found in plumbing systems. They can be turned on or off to control the flow of water. 1. What is the function of valves in the cardiovascular system? 2. Why are valves needed in the cardiovascular system? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The cardiovascular system is the system of organs that delivers blood to all the cells of the body. Its like the bodys lifeline. Without the cardiovascular system circulating your blood, you couldnt survive. </p>
        
        <p>

        <p>The diagram shows the circulatory system. It is the system that circulates blood and lymph through the body consisting of the heart, blood vessels, blood, lymph, and the lymphatic vessels and glands. Arterial circulation is the part of your circulatory system that involves arteries, like the aorta and pulmonary arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from your heart. (The exception is the coronary arteries, which supply your heart muscle with oxygen-rich blood.) Venous circulation is the part of your circulatory system that involves veins, like the vena cavae and pulmonary veins. Veins are blood vessels that carry blood to your heart. Veins have thinner walls than arteries.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the cross-section of the human heart. The human heart is divided into the left and right halves. The heart has an upper chamber called the atrium and a lower chamber called the ventricle in each half. The red arrows show oxygenated blood coming from the lungs into the left atrium which then flows into the left ventricle and leaves the heart through the aorta. The blue arrows show deoxygenated blood coming to the heart from the through the anterior and posterior vena cava, flows through the right atrium, right ventricle and enters into the lungs.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the different components that make up the heart. The heart is the key organ in the circulatory system. As a hollow, muscular pump, its main function is to propel blood throughout the body. The septum is the wall of muscle divides it down the middle, into a left half and a right half. There are 4 chambers in the heart: top chamber is called atrium; bottom chambers are called ventricles. Blood can flow from the atrium to ventricle because of openings called valves. Valves open in one direction like trapdoors to let the blood pass through, then they close, so the blood cannot flow backwards into the atria. There are also valves at the bottom of the large arteries that carry blood away from the heart: the aorta and the pulmonary artery. These valves keep the blood from flowing backward into the heart once it has been pumped out. Blood vessels of the body carry blood in a circle: moving away from the heart in arteries, traveling to various parts of the body in capillaries, and going back to the heart in veins. All the blood from the body is eventually collected into the two largest veins: the superior vena cava, which receives blood from the upper body, and the inferior vena cava, which receives blood from the lower body region.</p>
