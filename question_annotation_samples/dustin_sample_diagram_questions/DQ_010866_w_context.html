        <h3>Defining Acceleration</h3>
        <p>Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It shows how quickly velocity changes. Acceleration may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Because acceleration includes both a size (speed) and direction, it is a vector. People commonly think of acceleration as an increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative. Negative acceleration may be called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. You can see several examples of acceleration in Figure 12.11. If you are accelerating, you may be able to feel the change in velocity. This is true whether you change your speed or your direction. Think about what it feels like to ride in a car. As the car speeds up, you feel as though you are being pressed against the seat. The opposite occurs when the car slows down, especially if the change in speed is </p>

With a left turn, you feel a push to the right. The next time you ride in a car, notice how it feels as the car accelerates in each of these ways.

        <h3>Calculating Acceleration</h3>
        <p>Calculating acceleration is complicated if both speed and direction are changing. Its easier to calculate acceleration when only speed is changing. To calculate acceleration without a change in direction, you just divide the change in velocity (represented by Dv) by the change in time (represented by Dt). The formula for acceleration in this case is: Acceleration = Dv Dt Consider this example. The cyclist in Figure 12.12 speeds up as he goes downhill on this straight trail. His velocity changes from 1 meter per second at the top of the hill to 6 meters per second at the bottom. If it takes 5 seconds for him to reach the bottom, what is his acceleration, on average, as he flies down the hill? Acceleration = Dv 6 m/s 1 m/s 5 m/s 1 m/s = = = = 1 m/s2 Dt 5s 5s 1m In words, this means that for each second the cyclist travels downhill, his velocity increases by 1 meter per second (on average). The answer to this problem is expressed in the SI unit for acceleration: m/s2 ("meters per second squared"). You Try It! Problem: Tranh slowed his skateboard as he approached the street. He went from 8 m/s to 2 m/s in a period of 3 seconds. What was his acceleration? </p>

        <h3>VelocityTime Graphs</h3>
        <p>The acceleration of an object can be represented by a velocity-time graph like the one in Figure 12.13. A velocity- time graph shows how velocity changes over time. It is similar to a distance-time graph except the y axis represents velocity instead of distance. The graph in Figure 12.13 represents the velocity of a sprinter on a straight track. The runner speeds up for the first 4 seconds of the race, then runs at a constant velocity for the next 3 seconds, and finally slows to a stop during the last 3 seconds of the race. In a velocity-time graph, acceleration is represented by the slope of the graph line. If the line slopes upward, like the line between A and B in Figure 12.13, velocity is increasing, so acceleration is positive. If the line is horizontal, as it is between B and C, velocity is not changing, so acceleration is zero. If the line slopes downward, like the line between C and D, velocity is decreasing, so acceleration is negative.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It shows how quickly velocity changes and whether the change is positive or negative. It may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. To calculate acceleration without a change in direction, divide the change in velocity by the change in time. The slope of a velocity-time graph represents acceleration. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Imagine the thrill of riding on a roller coaster like the one in Figure 12.10. The coaster crawls to the top of the track and then flies down the other side. It also zooms around twists and turns at breakneck speeds. These changes in speed and direction are what make a roller coaster ride so exciting. Changes in speed or direction are called acceleration. </p>

        <p>Figure 1 presents different velocity-time graphs. A velocity-time graph shows how an object's velocity or speed changes over time. The y axis represents velocity (v), while the x axis represents time (t). In the graph for constant velocity, the line remains horizontal, showing that the velocity of the object does not change over time. In the graph for constant acceleration, the line slopes upwards, showing that the velocity of the object increases over time. This increase in velocity is called acceleration. In the graph for constant retardation, the line slopes downwards, which means that velocity decreases over time. This decrease is called retardation. Retardation can also be called negative acceleration or deceleration. A moving object can both accelerate and decelerate. In the graph for irregular motion, the line moves up and down. This means that the velocity of object increases and decreases several times.</p>

        <p>This Diagram shows a Velocity-time that is used for determine the acceleration of an object. The vertical axis of a velocity-time graph is the velocity of the object and the horizontal axis is the time taken from the start. When an object is moving with a constant velocity, the line on the graph is horizontal. When an object is moving with a steadily increasing velocity, or a steadily decreasing velocity, the line on the graph is straight, but sloped. The diagram shows some typical lines on a velocity-time graph. The steeper the line, the more rapidly the velocity of the object is changing. The blue line is steeper than the red line because it represents an object that is increasing in velocity much more quickly than the one represented by the red line.</p>
