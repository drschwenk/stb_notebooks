        <h3>Cell Membrane</h3>
        <p>The cell membrane is like the bag holding the Jell-O. It encloses the cytoplasm of the cell. It forms a barrier between the cytoplasm and the environment outside the cell. The function of the cell membrane is to protect and support the cell. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. It allows only certain substances to pass through. It keeps other substances inside or outside the cell. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Structure of the Cell Membrane</h3>
        <p>The structure of the cell membrane explains how it can control what enters and leaves the cell. The membrane is composed mainly of two layers of phospholipids. Figure 3.8 shows how the phospholipids are arranged in the cell membrane. Each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The heads are water loving (hydrophilic), and the tails are water fearing (hydrophobic). The water-loving heads are on the outer surfaces of the cell membrane. They point toward the watery cytoplasm within the cell or the watery fluid that surrounds the cell. The water-fearing tails are in the middle of the cell membrane. </p>

        <h3>How the Cell Membrane Works</h3>
        <p>Hydrophobic molecules like to be near other hydrophobic molecules. They fear being near hydrophilic molecules. The opposite is true of hydrophilic molecules. They like to be near other hydrophilic molecules. They fear being near hydrophobic molecules. These likes and fears explain why some molecules can pass through the cell membrane while others cannot. Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and fear the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cant pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane and fear the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

        </p>
        <h3>Cytoplasm and Cytoskeleton</h3>
        <p>Cytoplasm is everything inside the cell membrane (except the nucleus if there is one). It includes the watery, gel-like cytosol. It also includes other structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two-thirds of the cells weight. It gives the cell many of its properties. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Roles of Cytoplasm</h3>
        <p>Why does a cell have cytoplasm? Cytoplasm has several important functions. These include: suspending cell organelles. pushing against the cell membrane to help the cell keep its shape. providing a site for many of the biochemical reactions of the cell. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cytoskeleton</h3>
        <p>Crisscrossing the cytoplasm is a structure called the cytoskeleton. It consists of thread-like filaments and tubules. The cytoskeleton is like a cellular skeleton. It helps the cell keep its shape. It also holds cell organelles in place within the cytoplasm. Figure 3.9 shows several cells. In the figure, the filaments of their cytoskeletons are colored green. The tubules are colored red. The blue dots are the cell nuclei. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Organelles</h3>
        <p>Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and several other types of organelles. These structures carry out many vital cell functions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nucleus</h3>
        <p>The nucleus is the largest organelle in a eukaryotic cell. It contains most of the cells DNA. DNA, in turn, contains the genetic code. This code tells the cell which proteins to make and when to make them. You can see a diagram of a cell nucleus in Figure 3.10. Besides DNA, the nucleus contains a structure called a nucleolus. Its function is to form ribosomes. The membrane enclosing the nucleus is called the nuclear envelope. The envelope has tiny holes, or pores, in it. The pores allow substances to move into and out of the nucleus. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mitochondrion</h3>
        <p>The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine. Glucose is like a dollar bill. It contains too much energy for cells to use. ATP is like a quarter. It contains just the right amount of energy for use by cells. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ribosomes</h3>
        <p>A ribosome is a small organelle where proteins are made. Its like a factory in the cell. It gathers amino acids and joins them together into proteins. Unlike other organelles, the ribosome is not surrounded by a membrane. As a result, some scientists do not classify it as an organelle. Ribosomes may be found floating in the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are located on the surface of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Endoplasmic Reticulum</h3>
        <p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that helps make and transport proteins and lipids. Its made of folded membranes. Bits of membrane can pinch off to form tiny sacs called vesicles. The vesicles carry proteins or lipids away from the ER. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum. They are called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Both types are shown in Figure 3.11. NOTE: Crop to include only part a of the original image.] </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Golgi Apparatus</h3>
        <p>The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that sends proteins and lipids where they need to go. Its like a post office. It receives molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. It packages and labels the molecules. Then it sends them where they are needed. Some molecules are sent to different parts of the cell. Others are sent to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell. Small bits of membrane pinch off the Golgi apparatus to enclose and transport the proteins and lipids. You can see a Golgi apparatus at work in this animation: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Vesicles and Vacuoles</h3>
        <p>Both vesicles and vacuoles are sac-like organelles. They store and transport materials in the cell. They are like movable storage containers. Some vacuoles are used to isolate materials that are harmful to the cell. Other vacuoles are used to store needed substances such as water. Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and have a variety of functions. Some vesicles pinch off from the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These vesicles store and transport proteins and lipids. Other vesicles are used as chambers for biochemical reactions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lysosomes</h3>
        <p>A lysosome is an organelle that recycles unneeded molecules. It uses enzymes to break down the molecules into their components. Then the components can be reused to make new molecules. Lysosomes are like recycling centers. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Centrioles</h3>
        <p>Centrioles are organelles that are found only in animal cells. They are located near the nucleus. They help organize the DNA in the nucleus before cell division takes place. They ensure that the DNA divides correctly when the cell divides. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Special Structures in Plant Cells</h3>
        <p>All but one of the structures described above are found in plant cells as well as animal cells. The only exception is centrioles, which are not found in plant cells. Plant cells have three additional structures that are not found in animals cells. These include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids. You can see these structures in the model of a plant cell in Figure 3.12. You can also see them in the interactive plant cell at this link: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cell Wall</h3>
        <p>The cell wall is a rigid layer that surrounds the cell membrane of a plant cell. Its made mainly of the complex carbohydrate called cellulose. The cell wall supports and protects the cell. The cell wall isnt solid like a brick wall. It has tiny holes in it called pores. The pores let water, nutrients, and other substances move into and out of the cell. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Central Vacuole</h3>
        <p>Most plant cells have a large central vacuole. It can make up as much as 90 percent of a plant cells total volume. The central vacuole is like a large storage container. It may store substances such as water, enzymes, and salts. It may have other roles as well. For example, the central vacuole helps stems and leaves hold their shape. It may also contain pigments that give flowers their colors. </p>

        <h3>Plastids</h3>
        <p>Plastids are organelles in plant cells that may have various jobs. The main types of plastids are chloroplasts, chromoplasts, and leucoplasts. Chloroplasts are plastids that contain chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a green pigment. It gives plants their green color. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. They capture sunlight and use its energy to make glucose. Chromoplasts are plastids that contain other pigments. These other pigments give flowers and fruits their colors. Leucoplasts are plastids that make or store other molecules. For example, some leucoplasts make amino acids. Other leucoplasts store starch or oil. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Why is the nucleus like the control center of a cell? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe the structure and functions of the cell membrane.
Identify the parts and roles of the cytoplasm and cytoskeleton.
List organelles in eukaryotic cells and their special jobs.
Describe structures found in plant cells but not animal cells.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The cell membrane consists of two layers of phospholipids. It encloses the cytoplasm and controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cytoplasm consists of watery cytosol and cell structures. It has several functions. The cytoskeleton is the skeleton of the cell. It helps the cell keep its shape. Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and other organelles. They include the mitochondrion, endoplasmic reticu- lum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles, vacuoles, lysosomes, andin animal cellscentrioles. Each type of organelle has a special function. Plant cells have several structures not found in animal cells. They include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and plastids such as chloroplasts. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the cross section of an animal cell. It shows several parts of the cell such as the cell membrane, nucleus, mitochondrion, ribosomes and golgi body. The outermost part of the cell is called the cell membrane. It resembles a bag holding the cytoplasm and other parts of the cell. Cytoplasm is everything inside the cell membrane including the gall like cytosol. The nucleus is the largest organelle in the animal cell. It has an outer covering called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains most the cells DNA. The ribosomes are small organelles where proteins are made. The endoplasmic reticulum labelled as Rough ER and Smooth ER are organelles that help transport proteins and lipids. It is made up of folded membranes.</p>

        <p>This image shows the cross section of a plant cell. These eukaryotic cells differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms. Several structures are shown, such as the Golgi body, the chloroplast, the nucleus and the nucleolus. The Golgi body is a large organelle that sends proteins and lipids where they are necessary. The nucleus controls many of the functions of the cell (by controlling protein synthesis) and contains most of the cells DNA. The cell wall is a thick, rigid membrane made of cellulose that surrounds a plant cell. The vacuole is a large sac-like structure within a plant cell that is filled with fluid. The mitochondrion converts the energy stored in glucose into ATP, that is, adenosine triphosphate, for the cell.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the Anatomy of an Animal cell. Animal cells are had outer boundary known as the plasma membrane. The nucleus and the organelles of the cell are bound by a membrane. The genetic material (DNA) in animal cells is within the nucleus that is bound by a double membrane. The cell organelles have a vast range of functions to perform like hormone and enzyme production to providing energy for the cells. They are of various sizes and have irregular shapes. Most of the cells size range between 1 and 100 micrometers and are visible only with help of microscope. The animal cells perform variety of activities by the aid of the cellular organelles. These cells function as a unit and the cells together form tissues. A group go tissues with similar function from an organ and a group of organ of specific function to perform becomes and organ system.</p>

        <p>This diagram is of a plant cell. A plant cell has a cell wall and chloroplast, which sets it apart from an animal cell. The cell wall and membrane work to protect the cell. The chloroplast reflects green light, which gives plants their green color. Its ribosomes produce proteins. Its vacuole stores material. Its mitochondria provides energy and is known as the powerhouse of the cell. The nucleus and nucleolus store genetic material and work to control the cell and reproduce. The endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus play a role in producing proteins and moving materials, respectively. A given plant will have millions of these tiny cells that each work in different areas to provide life.</p>

        <p>The image below shows the Prokaryotic cell. A prokaryote is a single-celled organism that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus (karyon), mitochondria, or any other membrane-bound organelle. In the prokaryotes, all the intracellular water-soluble components (proteins, DNA and metabolites) are located together in the cytoplasm enclosed by the cell membrane, rather than in separate cellular compartments. Bacteria, however, do possess protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles enclosed in protein shells. At least some prokaryotes also contain intracellular structures that can be seen as primitive organelles. Membranous organelles (or intracellular membranes) are known in some groups of prokaryotes, such as vacuoles or membrane systems devoted to special metabolic properties, such as photosynthesis or chemolithotrophy. In addition, some species also contain carbohydrate-enclosed microcompartments, which have distinct physiological roles (e.g. carboxysomes or gas vacuoles).</p>
