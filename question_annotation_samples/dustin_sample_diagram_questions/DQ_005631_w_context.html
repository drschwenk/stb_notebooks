        <h3>Echinoderms</h3>
        <p>Echinoderms are invertebrates in Phylum Echinodermata. All of them are ocean dwellers. They can be found in marine habitats from the equator to the poles. They live at all depths of water. There are about 6000 living species of echinoderms. Besides sea urchins and sea cucumbers, they include sea stars (starfish), feather stars, and sand dollars.

        <h3>Spiny Skin and Tube Feet</h3>
        <p>The term echinoderm means spiny skin. An echinoderms spines arent actually made of skin. They are part of the animals endoskeleton and just covered with a thin layer of skin. Most adult echinoderms have radial symmetry. This is clear from the sea star pictured in Figure 12.29. However, echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry. You can tell because echinoderm larvae have bilateral symmetry and only develop radial symmetry as adults. Another unique trait of echinoderms is a network of internal canals. Most of the canals have projections called tube feet. The end of each tube foot has a sucker. The suckers can stick to surfaces and help the animal crawl. The suckers can also be used to pry open the shells of prey. You can see suckers on the sea star in Figure 12.29. Although echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and complete digestive system, they lack a centralized nervous system and do not have a heart. Some echinoderms have simple eyes that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms can regrow a missing body part. In fact, a complete starfish can regrow from a single arm. </p>

        <h3>How Echinoderms Reproduce</h3>
        <p>Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission. However, most echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes that produce sperm and eggs. Fertilization typically occurs outside the body in the water. Eggs hatch into larvae that have bilateral symmetry and can swim. The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>What Are Chordates</h3>
        <p>Chordates are animals in Phylum Chordata. They are animals that have a notochord and certain other traits. The notochord is a rigid rod that runs down the back of the body. Phylum Chordata is a large and diverse phylum. It includes at least 60,000 species, including the human species. For a visual introduction to chordates, watch this video: http://video.about.com/animals/What-Is-Phylum-Chordata-.htm </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>General Characteristics of Chordates</h3>
        <p>Chordates have three embryonic cell layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. They also have a segmented body with a complete coelom and bilateral symmetry. In addition, chordates have a complete digestive system, central nervous system, and circulatory system. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Defining Phylum Chordata</h3>
        <p>There are four traits that are unique to chordates and define Phylum Chordata. The four traits are a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, notochord, and pharyngeal slits. You can see the four traits in Figure 12.30. 1. The post-anal tail is at the end of the organism opposite the head. It extends beyond the anus. 2. The hollow nerve cord runs along the top (dorsal) side of the animal. (In nonchordate animals, the nerve cord is solid and runs along the bottom side.) 3. The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and the digestive tract. It provides stiffness to counterbalance the pull of muscles. 4. The pharyngeal slits are located in the pharynx. The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts. In some chordates, all four of these defining traits last throughout life and have important functions. For example, in some chordates, pharyngeal slits are used to filter food out of water. In many chordates, however, including humans, all four traits are present only in the embryo. After that, some of the traits disappear or develop into other structures. For example, in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in the embryo but later develop into parts of the ear. </p>

        <h3>Invertebrate Chordates</h3>
        <p>Living chordates are mainly vertebrates. In vertebrates, the notochord develops into a backbone, or vertebral column, after the embryonic stage. A small percentage of chordates are invertebrates. Their notochord never develops into a backbone. Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. Both groups of animals are small and relatively primitive. They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Tunicates</h3>
        <p>Tunicates are invertebrate chordates that lose some of the four defining chordate traits by adulthood. Tunicates are also called sea squirts. There are about 3000 living species of tunicates. All are ocean dwellers and live in shallow water. You can see examples of tunicates in Figure 12.31. As larvae, tunicates can swim freely to find food. As adults, tunicates lack a post-anal tail and notochord, and they can no longer swim. Instead, they remain in one place and are filter feeders. Tunicates can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The same adults produce sperm and eggs. However, fertilization always involves gametes from different parents. Asexual reproduction is by budding. </p>

        <h3>Lancelets</h3>
        <p>Lancelets are invertebrate chordates that retain all four defining chordate traits as adults. There are only about 25 species of living lancelets. Lancelets resemble tunicates in several ways. For example: lancelets live in shallow ocean water; lancelet larvae can swim to find food; and lancelet adults are filter feeders that can no longer swim. Adult lancelets spend most of their time buried in sand on the ocean floor. Lancelets reproduce sexually, with separate sexes producing sperm and eggs. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Sea tulips and sea daisies are both invertebrates that live on the ocean floor. Sea tulips live along coasts at a maximum depth of about 80 meters. Sea daisies live in the deepest ocean. One of these two invertebrates is a tunicate and the other is an echinoderm. Which animal should be classified in each taxon? Explain your answer. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe echinoderms, their traits, and their reproduction.
Define chordates and list chordate traits.
Identify invertebrate chordates and their traits.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Echinoderms are ocean-dwelling invertebrates in Phylum Echinodermata. They include such animals as sea stars and sand dollars. They have a spiny endoskeleton, radial symmetry (as adults), and tube feet with suckers. They reproduce asexually or sexually. Chordates are animals in Phylum Chordata. Their defining traits are a notochord, post-anal tail, hollow dorsal nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. Some of these traits may disappear after the embryonic stage. Chordates include all of the vertebrates, in which the notochord develops into a backbone, as well as some invertebrates. Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. These animals are small and primitive and live in shallow ocean water. Lancelets retain all four defining chordate traits throughout life. Tunicates lose some of these traits by adulthood. Both tunicate and lancelet larvae are free swimming, whereas the adults are filter feeders that cannot swim. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>1. Echinoderm adults have radial symmetry. What evidence shows that they evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry? 2. Explain what distinguishes vertebrate chordates from invertebrate chordates. 3. Compare and contrast tunicates and lancelets. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the anatomy of a Starfish. Starfish (properly called sea stars) are any echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea The cardiac stomach is the part of the stomach of a starfish used for pumping blood. Pyloric stomach: part of the stomach of a starfish connected to the duodenum. Water enters the starfish through the madreporite, a porous structure. There are two glands located in each arm called gonads. They are responsible for the production of gametes (spermatozoids or ovules) depending on the sex of the starfish. Starfish are composed of a central disc from which arms sprout. Most starfish have 5 arms.</p>
