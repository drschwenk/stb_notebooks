        <h3>What Are Plants</h3>
        <p>Plants are multicellular eukaryotes that are placed in the Plant Kingdom. Plant cells have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. They allow plants to make food by photosynthesis. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs that produce gametes. Male reproductive organs produce sperm. Female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Needs of Plants</h3>
        <p>Plants are somewhat limited by temperature in terms of where they can grow. They need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing. They also need light, carbon dioxide, and water. These substances are required for photosynthesis. Like most other living things, plants need oxygen. Oxygen is required for cellular respiration. In addition, plants need minerals. The minerals are required to make proteins and other organic molecules. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Importance of Plants</h3>
        <p>Life as we know it would not be possible without plants. Why are plants so important? Plants supply food to nearly all land organisms, including people. We mainly eat either plants or other living things that eat plants. Plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis. Oxygen is needed by all aerobic organisms. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. This helps control the greenhouse effect and global warming. Plants recycle matter in ecosystems. For example, they are an important part of the water cycle. They take up liquid water from the soil through their roots. They release water vapor to the air from their leaves. This is called transpiration. Plants provide many products for human use. They include timber, medicines, dyes, oils, and rubber. Plants provide homes for many other living things. For example, a single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of animals, like the birds in Figure 10.2. </p>

        <h3>Plant Tissues</h3>
        <p>A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function. Modern plants have three major types of tissues. Theyre called dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Dermal Tissue</h3>
        <p>Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant. Its like the plants skin. Cells of dermal tissue secrete a waxy substance called cuticle. Cuticle helps prevent water loss and damage to the plant. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ground Tissue</h3>
        <p>Ground tissue makes up much of the inside of a plant. The cells of ground tissue carry out basic metabolic functions and other biochemical reactions. Ground tissue may also store food or water. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Vascular Tissue</h3>
        <p>Vascular tissue runs through the ground tissue inside a plant. It transports fluids throughout the plant. Vascular tissue actually consists of two types of tissues, called xylem and phloem. The two types of vascular tissue are packaged together in bundles. You can see them in the celery in Figure 10.3. Xylem carries water and dissolved minerals from the roots upward to the leaves. Phloem carries water and dissolved sugar from the leaves to other parts of the plant. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Plant Organs</h3>
        <p>An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to do a specific task. Most modern plants have several organs that help them survive and reproduce in a variety of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves. These and other plant organs generally contain all three major tissue types. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Roots</h3>
        <p>Roots are important organs in most modern plants. There are two types of roots: primary roots, which grow downward; and secondary roots, which branch out to the sides. Together, all the roots of a plant make up the plants root system. Figure 10.4 shows two different types of plant root systems. A taproot system has a very long primary root, called a taproot. A fibrous root system has many smaller roots and no large, primary root. The roots of plants have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals, anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food. Roots are covered with thin-walled dermal cells and tiny root hairs. These features are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil. Root systems help anchor plants to the ground. They allow plants to grow tall without toppling over. A tough covering may replace the dermal cells in older roots. This makes them ropelike and even stronger. In many plants, ground tissue in roots stores food produced by the leaves during photosynthesis. </p>
        
        <p>

        <p>FIGURE 10.4 Two types of root systems</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Stems</h3>
        <p>Stems are organs that hold plants upright. They allow plants to get the sunlight and air they need. Stems also bear leaves, flowers, cones, and smaller stems. These structures grow at points called nodes. The stem between nodes is called an internode. (See Figure 10.5.) Stems are needed for transport and storage. Their vascular tissue carries water and minerals from roots to leaves. It carries dissolved sugar from the leaves to the rest of the plant. Without this connection between roots and leaves, plants could not survive high above the ground in the air. In many plants, ground tissue in stems also stores food or water during cold or dry seasons. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Leaves</h3>
        <p>Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to virtually all life on land. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. Leaves vary in size, shape, and how they are arranged on stems. You can see examples of different types of leaves in Figure 10.6. Each type of leaf is well suited for the plants environment. It maximizes light exposure while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. For example, some leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. Leaves are basically factories for photosynthesis. A factory has specialized machines to produce a product. In a leaf, the "machines" are the chloroplasts. A factory is connected to a transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries away the finished product. In a leaf, transport is carried out by veins containing vascular tissue. Veins carry water and minerals to the cells of leaves. They carry away dissolved sugar. A factory has bricks, siding, or other external protection. A leaf is covered with dermal cells. They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent evaporation of water from the leaf. A factory has doors and windows to let some materials enter and leave. The surface of the leaf has tiny pores called stomata (stoma, singular). They can open and close to control the movement of gases between the leaves and the air. You can see a close-up of a stoma in Figure 10.7. </p>

        <h3>How Plants Grow</h3>
        <p>Most plants continue to grow throughout their lives. Like other multicellular organisms, plants grow through a combination of cell growth and cell division. Cell growth increases cell size. Cell division increases the number of cells. As plant cells grow, they also become specialized into different cell types. Once cells become specialized, they can no longer divide. So how do plants grow after that? The key to continued growth is meristem. Meristem is a type of plant tissue consisting of undifferentiated cells that can continue to divide. Meristem at the tips of roots and stems allows them to grow in length. This is called primary growth. The stem (trunk) of the giant sequoia tree in Figure 10.8 has achieved amazing growth in length during its many years of life. Meristem within and around vascular tissues allows growth in width. This is called secondary growth. The rings in the tree stump in Figure 10.8 show secondary growth in a tree. Each ring represents one year of growth. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Alternation of Generations</h3>
        <p>Plants alternate between haploid and diploid generations. Haploid cells have one of each pair of chromosomes. Diploid cells have two of each pair. Plants in the haploid generation are called gametophytes. They form from haploid spores. They have male and/or female reproductive organs and reproduce sexually. They produce haploid gametes by mitosis. Fertilization of gametes produces diploid zygotes. Zygotes develop into the diploid generation. Plants in the diploid generation are called sporophytes. They form from the fertilization of gametes. They reproduce asexually. They have a structure called a sporangium that produces haploid spores by meiosis. Spores develop into the haploid generation. Then the cycle repeats. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Variation in the Life Cycle of Plants</h3>
        <p>One of the two generations of a plants life cycle is usually dominant. Individuals in the dominant generation generally live longer and grow larger. They are the organisms that you would recognize as a fern, tree, or other plant. Individuals in the nondominant generation tend to be smaller and shorter-lived. They often live in or on the dominant plant. They may go unnoticed. Early plants spent most of their life cycle as gametophytes. Some modern plants such as mosses still have this type of life cycle. However, almost all modern plants spend most of their life cycle as sporophytes. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. Choose one of the three main organs of plants: roots, stems, or leaves. State the primary function of the organ. Then explain how the organs structure suits it for its function. 5. A certain plant spends most of its life cycle as a haploid organism. Is the plant a flowering plant such as a daisy or is it a species of moss? Explain your answer. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Plants are multicellular eukaryotes in the Plant Kingdom. They have cell walls of cellulose and chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Life as we know it depends on plants. They feed most other organisms. They also perform many other services. Modern plants have three different types of tissues. They are called dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. Each type of tissue has a different function. The three types of tissues work together in most plant organs. Three organs commonly found in modern plants are roots, stems, and leaves. Plants continue to grow throughout life. Cells increase in both size and number. Undifferentiated cells in meristem tissue can keep dividing. They allow growth to continue. All plants have a life cycle that alternates between haploid and diploid generations. Plants vary in terms of which generation is dominant. Most modern plants have a dominant diploid generation. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Most modern plants, like the skunk cabbage, produce flowers. However, flowers evolved relatively late in the history of plants. The earliest plants not only lacked flowers. They also lacked leaves, roots, and stems. They probably resembled the alga in Figure 10.1. If the earliest plants were so different from modern plants, why are they even considered plants? What traits define a plant? Before reading the answer to this question, watch this amazing visual introduction to plants:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <p>The diagram below shows a very basic picture of a plant leaf including 6 parts of said leaf. Transport is carried out by veins containing vascular tissue. Petiole is the thin flat portion that attaches the leaf to a stem. The blade is the part of the leaf that is most commonly associated with the idea of a leaf. Axil is the upper angle of a leaf. A stipule is a small appendage to a leaf and typically comes in pairs.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the cross section of a leaf. The leaves are the major site of food production for the plant, through a process called photosynthesis. A leaf is made of many layers covered by two layers of tough skin cells (the epidermis). The epidermis also secretes a waxy substance called cuticle. Each pair of guard cells forms a pore (called stoma; the plural is stomata). Gases enter and exit the leaf through the stomata. Veins support the leaf and are filled with vessels that transport food, water, and minerals to the plant. Most food production takes place in the palisade mesophyll. Gas exchange occurs in the air spaces between the oddly-shaped cells of the spongy mesophyll.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the main parts of a cross section of a typical plant leaf. The cross section of a typical leaf is divisible into three main parts namely, the Epidermis, Mesophyll, and the Veins. The Epidermis is made of several layers of cells that are sandwiched between two layers. The Epidermis protects the tissues which lie between them and also helps in the process of gaseous exchange. Epidermis is further divisible into two types called, the Upper Epidermis and the Lower Epidermis. Beneath the Epidermis is the Mesophyll where Photosynthesis takes place. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make their own food like sugars & amino acids. The Veins (surrounded by the Bundle sheath cells) provides the necessary support to the leaf in the transport of water and plant food to other parts of the plant. The Stoma located in the Lower Epidermis is an opening that control the gaseous exchange that occurs between the leaf and the atmosphere during photosynthesis. The gas exchange involves the use of common gas like Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the parts of a leaf. The Blade is the broad flat part of the leaf. The Petiole is the stem like part of the leaf that joins the blade to the stem. The Stipules are two small flaps that grow at the base of the petiole of some plants. A leaf has several veins. Veins carry food and water in a leaf. They also support the blade. The large central vein which extends from the base of the blade to its tip is called the Midrib. Smaller veins connect the midrib to other parts of the blade.</p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the parts of a plant. The root is the part of the plant that lies below the surface It helps to anchor the plant in the soil. It also absorbs nutrients and water from the soil. The stem, leaves, fruits and flowers are present above the surface. Stems support the plant and transport water and nutrients from the roots and food in the form of glucose from the leaves to other plant parts. A plant usually has many leaves which are green. Leaves are designed to capture sunlight which the plant uses to make food through a process called photosynthesis. Flowers are usually colorful and attract bees that help in pollination. Fruits provide a covering for seeds.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the different parts of a plant. The root of a plant perform two main functions. First, they anchor the plant to the ground. Second, they absorb water and various nutrients dissolved in water from the soil. Plants use the water to make food. The stem is along with the root one of two main structural axes of a vascular plant. The stem is normally divided into nodes and internodes, the nodes hold leaves, flowers, cones, axillary buds, or other stems. The Branch is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub). A leaf is an above-ground plant organ. Its main functions are photosynthesis and gas exchange. A flower is a special kind of plant part. The flower grows on a stalk a thin node which supports it. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the structure of a flowering plant. The roots are located underground and often span out further than the plant itself does. The roots take up water and nutrients from the ground to feed the plant. These materials move up through the stem to the fruit, flowers, and leaves. The plant takes in water, sunlight, and CO2 to produce oxygen and glucose. As the plant takes in more nutrients, water, sunlight, and CO2, it grows and produces flowers and fruit. Flowers and fruit attract insects who will feed on nectar while spreading pollen and seeds from plant to plant. This helps the plant reproduce and form new plants that will work in the same way.</p>

        <p>This diagram illustrates three different types of leaves: simple, palmately compound, and pinnately compound. Simple leaves have undivided blades with either lobed or toothed margins. Compound leaves, in contrast, are composed of multiple leaflets. Compound leaves are further grouped into palmate and pinnate leaves. Palmate leaves have leaflets radiating outwards from the end of the petiole, while the leaflets of a pinnate leave are all arranged around the middle vein. To identify whether a leaf is simple or compound, inspect the base of the leaf. Every leaf, whether simple or compound, will have a bud at the base of its petiole, but individual leaflets of a compound leaf will not. All leaves, regardless of type, serve a common function; to help the plant produce food by converting sunlight into chemical energy that the plant can consume.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows four ways leaves can be arranged on their stems. The titles describe the names of these arrangements, which help scientists identify the family and type of plant. A simple leaf arrangement consists of a single leaf attached to the stem. A pinnately compound leaf consists of several leaves or leaflets attached in parallel pairs to a central stem, with a leaf at the tip of the stem. A palmately compound leaf consists of more than three leaflets attached at a central point, reminiscent of a human hand (or palm). A doubly compound leaf is twice divided. The leaflets are arranged in pairs along a stem, which itself is arranged in pairs along a larger stem. The more area a leaf takes up, the more sunlight it can absorb, but in return it will lose more moisture to air flow. Small leaflets, such as doubly compound leaves, reduce both wind resistance and water loss.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows plant leaves and their variety of shapes. Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to virtually all life on land. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight and make food by photosynthesis. Leaves vary in size, shape, and how they are arranged on stems. Each type of leaf is well suited for the plants environment. It maximizes light exposure while conserving water, reducing wind resistance, or benefiting the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. For example, some leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. Leaves are basically factories for photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plant produces their own food. A leaf is covered with dermal cells. They secrete waxy cuticle to prevent evaporation of water from the leaf. A factory has doors and windows to let some materials enter and leave. The surface of the leaf has tiny pores called stomata (stoma, singular). They can open and close to control the movement of gases between the leaves and the air.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows a leaf identification chart. Plants have leaves in many shapes, arrangements, margins and venation. Leaves are classified as either alternate, spiral, opposite, or whorled. Plants that have only one leaf per node have leaves that are said to be either alternate or spiral. Alternate leaves alternate on each side of the stem in a flat plane, and spiral leaves are arranged in a spiral along the stem. In an opposite leaf arrangement, two leaves arise at the same point, with the leaves connecting opposite each other along the branch. If there are three or more leaves connected at a node, the leaf arrangement is classified as whorled. The leaf margin is the boundary area extending along the edge of the leaf. There are lots of different types of leaf margins that are important for plant identification. Some common types include entire, crenate and lobate. Leaf venation refers to the arrangement pattern of the veins of the leaf. The pattern of leaf venation is also an important characteristic for the identification of plants. Leaf venation has two common types-reticulate venation and parallel venation. In reticulate venation, all the veins are interconnected, like the strands of the net. In parallel venation, the veins run parallel or nearly parallel to each other and are connected by smaller veins.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the different types of leaf margins. The leaf margin is the boundary area extending along the edge of the leaf. There are lots of different types of leaf margins that are important for plant identification. The entire margin leaf has no serrated edges, and is composed by one continuous, smooth surface around the whole plant. The singly-toothed margin is a leaf with serrated or toothed edges that point upwards, like the viola or mint leaf. It is the most common type of leaf, as it brings more of the leaf's surface into contact with the air and so facilitates photosynthesis. The doubly-toothed has small and larger serrations, twice serrated. Lobed edged leaves are characterized by their lobes slightly marked, nervations coming from the center of the leaf and a serrated base.</p>
