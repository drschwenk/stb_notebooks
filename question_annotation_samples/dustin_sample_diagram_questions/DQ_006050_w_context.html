        <h3>What Are Muscles</h3>
        <p>Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. Muscles are composed primarily of cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber is a very long, thin cell, as you can see in Figure 16.16. It contains multiple nuclei and many mitochondria, which produce ATP for energy. It also contains many organelles called myofibrils. Myofibrils allow muscles to contract, or shorten. Muscle contractions are responsible for virtually all the movements of the body, both inside and out. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How a Muscle Contracts</h3>
        <p>To understand how a muscle contracts, you need to dive deeper into the structure of muscle fibers. You can see in Figure 16.16 that a muscle fiber is full of myofibrils. Each myofibril is made up of two types of proteins, called actin and myosin. These proteins form thread-like filaments. The myosin filaments use energy from ATP to pull on the actin filaments. This causes the actin filaments to slide over the myosin filaments and shorten a section of the myofibril. You can see a simple animation of the process at this link: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Actin_Myosin.gif The sliding-and-shortening process occurs all along many myofibrils and in many muscle fibers. It causes the muscle fibers to shorten and the muscle to contract. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Muscle Tissue</h3>
        <p>There are three different types of muscle tissue in the human body: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. All three types consist mainly of muscle fibers, but the fibers have different arrangements. You can see how each type of muscle tissue looks in Figure 16.17. Cardiac muscle is found only in the walls of the heart. It is striated, or striped, because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of cardiac muscle are involuntary. This means that they are not under conscious control. When cardiac muscle contracts, the heart beats and pumps blood. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of other internal organs such as the stomach. It isnt striated because its muscle fibers are arranged in sheets rather than bundles. Contractions of smooth muscle are involuntary. When smooth muscles in the stomach contract, they squeeze food inside the stomach. This helps break the food into smaller pieces. Skeletal muscle is attached to the bones of the skeleton. It is striated like cardiac muscle because its muscle fibers are arranged in bundles. Contractions of skeletal muscle are voluntary. This means that they are under conscious control. Whether you are doing pushups or pushing a pencil, you are using skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are the most common type of muscles in the body. You can read more about them below. </p>

        <h3>A Closer Look at Skeletal Muscles</h3>
        <p>The human body has more than 600 skeletal muscles. You can see some of them in Figure 16.18. A few of the larger muscles are labeled in the figure. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure and Function of Skeletal Muscles</h3>
        <p>You can see the bundles of muscle fibers that make up a skeletal muscle in Figure 16.19. You can also see in the figure how the muscle is attached to a bone by a tendon. Tendons are tough connective tissues that anchor skeletal muscles to bones throughout the body. Many skeletal muscles are attached to the ends of bones where they meet at a joint. The muscles span the joint and connect the bones. When the muscles contract, they pull on the bones, causing them to move. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Skeletal Muscles Work in Pairs</h3>
        <p>Muscles can only contract. They cant actively lengthen. Therefore, to move bones back and forth at a joint, skeletal muscles must work in pairs. For example, the bicep and triceps muscles of the upper arm work as a pair. You can see how this pair of muscles works in Figure 16.20. When the bicep muscle contracts, it bends the arm at the elbow. When the triceps muscle contracts, it straightens the arm. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Your Muscular System Healthy</h3>
        <p>Did you ever hear the saying, Use it or lose it? Thats certainly true when it comes to muscles. If you dont exercise your muscles, they will actually shrink in size. They will also become weaker and more prone to injury. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Keeping Muscles Strong</h3>
        <p>Exercising muscles increases their size, and bigger muscles have greater strength. What type of exercises should you do? For all-round muscular health, you should do two basic types of exercise. To increase the size and strength of skeletal muscles, you need to make these muscles contract against a resisting force. For example, you can do sit-ups or pushups, where the resisting force is your own body weight. You can see another way to do it in Figure 16.21. To exercise cardiac muscle and increase muscle endurance, you need to do aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise increases the size and strength of muscles in the heart and helps all your muscles develop greater endurance. This means they can work longer without getting tired. Aerobic exercise is any exercise such as running, biking, or swimming that causes an increase in your heart rate. You can see another example of aerobic exercise in Figure 16.22. Lifting weights is one way to pit skeletal muscles against a resisting force. Snowshoeing is a fun way to get aerobic exercise. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Preventing Muscle Injuries</h3>
        <p>You are less likely to have a muscle injury if you exercise regularly and have strong muscles. Stretching also helps prevent muscle injuries. Stretching improves the range of motion of muscles and tendons at joints. You should always warm up before stretching or doing any type of exercise. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to be injured. One way to warm up is to jog slowly for a few minutes. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. They consist primarily of long, thin cells called muscle fibers. A muscle fiber contracts when myosin filaments pull on actin filaments in myofibrils throughout the fiber. There are three types of muscle tissues: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle tissues. Most muscles are skeletal muscles, which are attached to bones by tendons. Skeletal muscles work in pairs to move bones back and forth at joints. Regular resistance exercise and aerobic exercise, preceded by warming up and stretching, can help keep the muscular system strong and healthy. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>You may think of muscles as the end result of exercises, like the pushups the soldier in Figure 16.15 is doing. Muscles in the arms and shoulders, which move the body, are easy to see and feel. However, they arent the only type of muscles. Many muscles are deep inside the body, mostly in the walls of organs. For example, your heart is almost completely muscle. These muscles dont directly move your body, but you couldnt survive without them. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the entire muscular system of the human body. Muscles are the main organs of the muscular system. Their main function is movement of the body. Muscles are the only tissue in our bodies that can contract and therefore move the other parts of the body. They are composed primarily of muscle fibers. Many muscles derive their name from their anatomical region. The rectus abdominis, for example, is found in the abdominal region. A function of the muscular system is to produce body heat. As a result of contraction, our muscular system produces waste heat.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the huma's body muscular system. Most muscles are attached to bones with tendons. Many muscles derive their name from their anatomical region. For example, the Rectus Abdominis is found in the abdominal region. Other muscles, like the Tibialis Anterior are named after the bone they are attached to, in this case the tibia. Other muscles are classified by form. The Deltoid have a delta or a triangular shape.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the structure of human back. The human back is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck and the shoulders. It is the surface opposite to the chest, its height being defined by the vertebral column (commonly referred to as the spine or backbone) and its breadth being supported by the ribcage and shoulders. The spinal canal runs through the spine and provides nerves to the rest of the body. Trapezius is either of a pair of large triangular muscles extending over the back of the neck and shoulders and moving the head and shoulder blade. The triceps brachii muscle is the large muscle on the back of the upper limb of many vertebrates. The latissimus dorsi of the back is the larger, flat, dorso-lateral muscle on the trunk, posterior to the arm. Gluteus is any of three muscles in each buttock which move the thigh, the largest of which is the gluteus maximus.</p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the structure of muscle cells. Muscle cells are also known as muscle fibers. The diagram illustrates components such as striated myofibrils, which is exclusive to that kind of cell. Myofibrils consist of filaments. There are thin filaments and thick filaments. Each cell is covered by a plasma membrane sheath which is called the sarcolemma. Tunnel-like extensions from the sarcolemma pass through the muscle fibre from one side of it to the other in transverse sections through the diameter of the fibre. The cell contains sarcoplasm, which is the cytoplasm of muscle cells.</p>

        <p>This diagram represents the structure of a skeletal muscle. Each skeletal muscle fiber is a single cylindrical muscle cell. Each muscle is surrounded by a connective tissue sheath called the epimysium. Fascia, connective tissue outside the epimysium, surrounds and separates the muscles. Portions of the epimysium project inward to divide the muscle into compartments. Each compartment contains a bundle of muscle fibers. Each bundle of muscle fiber is called a fasciculus and is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the perimysium. Within the fasciculus, each individual muscle cell, called a muscle fiber, is surrounded by connective tissue called the endomysium. The connective tissue covering furnish support and protection for the delicate cells and allow them to withstand the forces of contraction. The coverings also provide pathways for the passage of blood vessels and nerves. Commonly, the epimysium, perimysium, and endomysium extend beyond the fleshy part of the muscle, the belly or gaster, to form a thick ropelike tendon or a broad, flat sheet-like aponeurosis. The tendon and aponeurosis form indirect attachments from muscles to the periosteum of bones or to the connective tissue of other muscles.</p>
