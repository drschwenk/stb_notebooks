        <h3>Effect on Global Climate</h3>
        <p>Surface currents play an enormous role in Earths climate. Even though the Equator and poles have very different climates, these regions would have more extremely different climates if ocean currents did not transfer heat from the equatorial regions to the higher latitudes. The Gulf Stream is a river of warm water in the Atlantic Ocean, about 160 kilometers wide and about a kilometer deep. Water that enters the Gulf Stream is heated as it travels along the Equator. The warm water then flows up the east coast of North America and across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe (see opening image). The energy the Gulf Stream transfers is enormous: more than 100 times the worlds energy demand. The Gulf Streams warm waters raise temperatures in the North Sea, which raises the air temperatures over land between 3 to 6 C (5 to 11 F). London, U.K., for example, is at about six degrees further south than Quebec, Canada. However, Londons average January temperature is 3.8 C (38 F), while Quebecs is only -12 C (10 F). Because air traveling over the warm water in the Gulf Stream picks up a lot of water, London gets a lot of rain. In contrast, Quebec is much drier and receives its precipitation as snow.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Water in the Gulf Stream travels along the Equator and is heated as it goes. The Gulf Stream brings warm water north along the Atlantic coast of the United States and then across the northern Atlantic to the British Isles. A tremendous amount of energy is transferred from the equatorial regions to the polar regions by ocean currents. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. Explain why England is relatively mild and rainy in winter but central Canada, at the same latitude and during the same season, is dry and frigid. 2. Where else do you think ocean currents might moderate global climate? 3. What would Earth be like if ocean water did not move? </p>
