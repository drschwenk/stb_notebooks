        <h3>Clues from Fossils</h3>
        <p>Fossils are our best form of evidence about Earth history, including the history of life. Along with other geological evidence from rocks and structures, fossils even give us clues about past climates, the motions of plates, and other major geological events. Since the present is the key to the past, what we know about a type of organism that lives today can be applied to past environments. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>History of Life on Earth</h3>
        <p>That life on Earth has changed over time is well illustrated by the fossil record. Fossils in relatively young rocks resemble animals and plants that are living today. In general, fossils in older rocks are less similar to modern organisms. We would know very little about the organisms that came before us if there were no fossils. Modern technology has allowed scientists to reconstruct images and learn about the biology of extinct animals like dinosaurs! Click image to the left for more content. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Environment of Deposition</h3>
        <p>By knowing something about the type of organism the fossil was, geologists can determine whether the region was terrestrial (on land) or marine (underwater) or even if the water was shallow or deep. The rock may give clues to whether the rate of sedimentation was slow or rapid. The amount of wear and fragmentation of a fossil allows scientists to learn about what happened to the region after the organism died; for example, whether it was exposed to wave action. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Geologic History</h3>
        <p>The presence of marine organisms in a rock indicates that the region where the rock was deposited was once marine. Sometimes fossils of marine organisms are found on tall mountains indicating that rocks that formed on the seabed were uplifted. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>By knowing something about the climate a type of organism lives in now, geologists can use fossils to decipher the climate at the time the fossil was deposited. For example, coal beds form in tropical environments but ancient coal beds are found in Antarctica. Geologists know that at that time the climate on the Antarctic continent was much warmer. Recall from Concept Plate Tectonics that Wegener used the presence of coal beds in Antarctica as one of the lines of evidence for continental drift. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Index Fossils</h3>
        <p>An index fossil can be used to identify a specific period of time. Organisms that make good index fossils are distinctive, widespread, and lived briefly. Their presence in a rock layer can be used to identify rocks that were deposited at that period of time over a large area. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Fossils tell a lot about the environment during the time they were deposited. Climate is one important thing that can be indicated by fossils since organisms have specific conditions in which they can live. An index fossil must be distinctive, widespread and short-lived so that it can identify a specific period of time. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. How does a single fossil or set of fossils help geologists to decipher the geological history of an area? 2. How is an index fossil used to identify a time period? 3. Why are the fossils of marine organisms sometimes found in rock units at the tops of high mountains? What evidence would you look for to determine if this reason is plausible? </p>
