        <h3>Effects of Water Pollution</h3>
        <p>Water pollutants can have an effect on both the ecology of ecosystems and on humans. As a result of water pollution, humans may not be able to use a waterway for recreation and fishing. Drinking water can also be affected if a toxin enters the groundwater. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Eutrophication</h3>
        <p>In a marine ecosystem, algae are the producers. Through photosynthesis, they provide glucose for the ecosystem. So, can too much algae be a bad thing? Eutrophication is an over-enrichment of chemical nutrients in a body of water. Usually these nutrients are the nitrogen and phosphorous found in fertilizers. Run-off from lawns or farms can wash fertilizers into rivers or coastal waters. Plants are not the only things that grow more quickly with added fertilizers. Algae like the excess nutrients in fertilizers too. When there are high levels of nutrients in the water, algae populations will grow large very quickly. This leads to overgrowths of algae called algal blooms. However, these algae do not live very long. They die and begin to decompose. This process uses oxygen, removing the oxygen from the water. Without oxygen, fish and shellfish cannot live, and this results in the death of these organisms ( Figure 1.1). Certain types of algal blooms can also create toxins. These toxins can enter shellfish. If humans eat these shellfish, then they can get very sick. These toxins cause neurological problems in humans. </p>

        <h3>Ocean Acidification</h3>
        <p>Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Aquatic Debris</h3>
        <p>Aquatic debris is trash that gets into fresh- and saltwater waterways. It comes from shipping accidents, landfill erosion, or the direct dumping of trash. Debris can be very dangerous to aquatic wildlife. Some animals may swallow plastic bags, mistaking them for food. Other animals can be strangled by floating trash like plastic six-pack rings. Wildlife can easily get tangled in nets ( Figure 1.2). Marine trash can harm different types of aquatic life. Pictured here is a marine turtle entangled in a net. How can you keep this from happening? </p>

        <h3>Waterborne Diseases</h3>
        <p>Unsafe water supplies have drastic effects on human health. Waterborne diseases are diseases due to microscopic pathogens in fresh water. These diseases can be caused by protozoa, viruses, bacteria, and intestinal parasites. In many parts of the world there are no water treatment plants. If sewage or animal manure gets into a river, then people downstream will get sick when they drink the water. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal disease is responsible for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It was estimated that 88% of the cases of diarrheal disease are caused by unsafe water supplies. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>High levels of nutrients, called eutrophication, can cause conditions that deprive fish of oxygen. Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic, which harms corals and shellfish. Debris can be dangerous to aquatic wildlife. </p>
