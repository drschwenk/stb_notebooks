        <h3>Human Actions and Soil Erosion</h3>
        <p>Runoff carved channels in the soil in Figure 19.1. Running water causes most soil erosion, but wind can carry soil away too. What humans do to soil makes it more or less likely to be eroded by wind or water. Human actions that can increase soil erosion are described below. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Growing Crops</h3>
        <p>The photos in Figure 19.2 show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3>Grazing Animals</h3>
        <p>As you can see in Figure 19.3, some grazing animals, especially sheep and goats, eat grass right down to the roots. They may even pull the grass entirely out of the ground. Grazing animals can kill the grass or thin it out so much that it offers little protection to the soil. If animals are kept in the same place too long, the soil may become completely bare. The bare soil is easily eroded by wind and water. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>FIGURE 19.3 Sheep and goats can damage plants and leave the soil bare.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Logging Mining and Construction</h3>
        <p>Other human actions that put soil at risk include logging, mining, and construction. You can see examples of each in Figure 19.4. When forests are cut down, the soil is suddenly exposed to wind and rain. Without trees, there is no leaf litter to cover the ground and protect the soil. When leaf litter decays, it adds humus and nutrients to the soil. Mining and construction strip soil off the ground and leave the land bare. Paved roads and parking lots prevent rainwater from soaking into the ground. This increases runoff and the potential for soil erosion. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recreation</h3>
        <p>Even things that people do for fun can expose soil to erosion. For example, overuse of hiking trails can leave bare patches of soil. Off-road vehicles cause even more damage. You can see examples of this in Figure 19.5. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Preventing Soil Erosion</h3>
        <p>Soil is a renewable resource, but it can take thousands of years to form. Thats why people need to do what they can to prevent soil erosion. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Farming Methods that Reduce Soil Erosion</h3>
        <p>The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. </p>
        
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Other Ways to Reduce Soil Erosion</h3>
        <p>There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are shown in Figure 19.7. Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field. This gives the grass a chance to recover. Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil. Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place. Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff. Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>7. Off-road vehicles are popular in Pleasant Valley. Many people like to ride on a nearby grassy hillside. Write a letter to the editor of the Pleasant Valley Newspaper urging residents to protect the soil on the hillside. Your letter should explain why soil is important and why the soil on the hillside is at risk. Describe a better place to ride that is less likely to put soil at risk. 8. Look at Figure 19.8. Identify two farming methods that have been used to reduce soil loss. How do they help prevent erosion? </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Many human actions make it easier for wind and water to carry away soil. They include plowing, logging, construction, and even some types of recreation. Farming methods such as strip cropping and terracing help prevent soil erosion. Other ways to protect soil include replanting forests and reclaiming mine land. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Increasing soil erosion isnt the only way that human actions can affect the land. Many human actions also pollute the land. What is pollution? What human actions might pollute the land? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>It may just be dirt, but soil is one of our most important resources. We would starve without it. In fact, human beings  and most other land organisms  would never have evolved if it werent for soil. Thats because humans and other consumers rely on plants for food, and plants need soil. Soil anchors plant roots and provides them with water and nutrients. People have always depended on soil. But for many generations, they took soil for granted. They didnt realize that their actions would cause so much soil erosion. The Dust Bowl dramatically showed people what being careless with soil could do. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. How do plants help prevent soil loss? 2. How does logging endanger soil? 3. Describe the effects of construction on soil. 4. How do paved parking lots contribute to soil loss? 5. What is terracing? How does it reduce soil erosion? 6. What are cover crops, and why are they grown? </p>
