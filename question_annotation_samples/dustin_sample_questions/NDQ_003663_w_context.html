        <h3>Landforms from Lava</h3>
        <p>Extrusive igneous rocks cool at the surface. Volcanoes are one type of feature that forms from extrusive rocks. Several other interesting landforms are also extrusive features. Intrusive igneous rocks cool below the surface. These rocks do not always remain hidden. Rocks that formed in the crust are exposed when the rock and sediment that covers them is eroded away. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lava Domes</h3>
        <p>When lava is thick, it flows slowly. If thick lava makes it to the surface, it cannot flow far from the vent. It often stays right in the middle of a crater at the top of a volcano. Here the lava creates a large, round lava dome (Figure </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lava Plateaus</h3>
        <p>A lava plateau is made of a large amount of fluid lava. The lava flows over a large area and cools. This creates a large, flat surface of igneous rock. Lava plateaus may be huge. The Columbia Plateau covers over 161,000 square kilometers (63,000 square miles). It makes up parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Thin, fluid lava created the rock that makes up the entire ocean floor. This is from multiple eruptions from vents at the mid-ocean ridge. While not exactly a lava plateau, its interesting to think about so much lava! </p>

        <h3>New Land</h3>
        <p>New land is created in volcanic eruptions. The Hawaiian Islands are shield volcanoes. These volcanoes formed from fluid lava (Figure 8.21). The island grows as lava is added on the coast. New land may also emerge from lava that erupts from beneath the water. This is one way that new land is created. </p>

        <h3>Landforms from Magma</h3>
        <p>Magma that cools underground forms intrusions (Figure 8.22). Intrusions become land formations if they are exposed at the surface by erosion. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Hot Springs and Geysers</h3>
        <p>Water works its way through porous rocks or soil. Sometimes this water is heated by nearby magma. If the water makes its way to the surface, it forms a hot spring or a geyser. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Hot Springs</h3>
        <p>When hot water gently rises to the surface, it creates a hot spring. A hot spring forms where a crack in the Earth allows water to reach the surface after being heated underground. Many hot springs are used by people as natural hot tubs. Some people believe that hot springs can cure illnesses. Hot springs are found all over the world, even in Antarctica! </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Geysers</h3>
        <p>Geysers are also created by water that is heated beneath the Earths surface. The water may become superheated by magma. It becomes trapped in a narrow passageway. The heat and pressure build as more water is added. When the pressure is too much, the superheated water bursts out onto the surface. This is a geyser. There are only a few areas in the world where the conditions are right for the formation of geysers. Only about 1,000 geysers exist worldwide. About half of them are in the United States. The most famous geyser is Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park (Figure 8.23). It is rare for a geyser to erupt so regularly, which is why Old Faithful is famous. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>3. How does new land form? Are the oceans being taken over by land? Why or why not? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>List and describe landforms created by lava.
Explain how magma creates different landforms.
Describe the processes that create hot springs and geysers.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Very thick lava that doesnt travel very far can produce lava domes at or near the Earths surface or even within a volcano. Lava plateaus and the entire ocean floor form from large lava flows that spread out over large areas. Many islands are formed from volcanoes. Magma can also cool and crystallize below the Earths surface forming igneous intrusions. When magma heats groundwater, it can form hot springs and geysers. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 8.23 Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park erupts every 60 to 70 minutes, with a plume of hot water shooting up nearly 60 meters in the air.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>4. Millions of people flock to Yellowstone National Park each year. Why are they drawn to the place? Would it be visited as much if the park were full of hot springs that were not geysers? 5. Do you think that Old Faithful will someday stop erupting? Why would it do that? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>What might the Earth look like if there were no tectonic plates? Can you think of any planets or satellites (moons) that may not have tectonic plates? How is their surface different from that of the Earth? What kind of land formations have you seen that may have been created by volcanic activity? Did these rocks cool above or below the Earths surface? Water is not the only material that can be ejected from geysers and hot springs. What other materials might be ejected from geysers and hot springs? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What types of landforms form from intrusive igneous activity? 2. What types of landforms are created by lava? </p>
