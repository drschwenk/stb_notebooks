        <h3>Organisms and Environmental Factors</h3>
        <p>Organisms are individual living things. They range from microscopic bacteria to gigantic blue whales (see Figure must be obtained from the environment. Biotic factors are all of the living or once-living aspects of the environment. They include all the organisms that live there as well as the remains of dead organisms. Abiotic factors are all of the aspects of the environment that have never been alive. They include factors such as sunlight, minerals in soil, temperature, and moisture. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 23.1 Organisms show tremendous diversity. Some of the smallest and largest living or- ganisms are pictured here: billions of mi- croorganisms that thrive in this hot spring give it its striking colors (left); blue whales are the largest living organisms (right). Organisms depend on their environment to meet their needs, so they are greatly influenced by it. There are many factors in the environment that affect organisms. The factors can be classified as either biotic or abiotic.</p>

        <h3>Levels of Organization in Ecology</h3>
        <p>Ecologists study organisms and environments at several different levels, from the individual to the biosphere. The levels are depicted in Figure 23.2 and described below. For a video introduction to the levels of organization in ecology, click on this link:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  An individual is an organism, or single living thing. A population is a group of individuals of the same species that live in the same area. Members of the same population generally interact with each other. A community is made up of all the populations of all the species that live in the same area. Populations in a community also generally interact with each other. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 23.2 From individuals to the biosphere, ecol- ogy can be studied at several different levels. An ecosystem consists of all the biotic and abiotic factors in an area. It includes a community, the abiotic factors in the environment, and all their interactions. A biome is a group of similar ecosystems with the same general abiotic factors and primary producers. Biomes may be terrestrial (land-based) or aquatic (water-based). The biosphere consists of all the parts of Earth where life can be found. This is the highest level of organization in ecology. It includes all of the other levels below it. The biosphere consists of all the worlds biomes, both terrestrial and aquatic.</p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>3. Make an illustrated chart to show the different levels of organization in ecology. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Define ecology.
Distinguish between biotic and abiotic factors in the environment.
Outline levels of organization in ecology.
</p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Ecology is the science of how living things interact with each other and their environment. All organisms depend on their environment for energy and matter and are influenced by their environment. Factors in the environment that can affect organisms include biotic factors and abiotic factors. Ecologists study organisms and environments at several different levels. From smallest to largest, they include the individual, population, community, ecosystem, biome, and biosphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>4. Explain why organisms depend on their environment. 5. Compare and contrast biotic and abiotic factors in the environment. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The population is an important level of organization in ecology. It is also the unit of microevolution. 1. What is a population? 2. How can a population grow? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The science of how living things interact with each other and their environment is called ecology. Ecology is a major branch of life science, but it overlaps with many other fields. For example, it shares data and theories with geography, biology, climatology, and other sciences. In this lesson, youll learn some of the basic concepts of ecology. </p>
