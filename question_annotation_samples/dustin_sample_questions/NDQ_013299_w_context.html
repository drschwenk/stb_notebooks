        <h3>Acceleration Force and Mass</h3>
        <p>Newton determined that two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object and the objects mass. The relationships between these two factors and motion make up Newtons second law of motion. This law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the objects mass. This can be represented by the equation: Net force , or Mass F a= m Acceleration = You can watch a video about how Newtons second law of motion applies to football at this URL: http://science36 </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Direct and Inverse Relationships</h3>
        <p>Newtons second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration. The relationship between mass and acceleration, on the other hand, is an inverse relationship. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force. Consider the example of a batter, like the boy in Figure 14.6. The harder he hits the ball, the greater will be its acceleration. It will travel faster and farther if he hits it with more force. What if the batter hits a baseball and a softball with the same amount of force? The softball will accelerate less than the baseball because the softball has greater mass. As a result, it wont travel as fast or as far as the baseball. </p>

        <h3>Calculating Acceleration</h3>
        <p>The equation for acceleration given above can be used to calculate the acceleration of an object that is acted on by an unbalanced force. For example, assume you are pushing a large wooden trunk, like the one shown in Figure acceleration of the trunk, substitute these values in the equation for acceleration: a= F 20 N 2N = = m 10 kg kg Recall that one newton (1 N) is the force needed to cause a 1-kilogram mass to accelerate at 1 m/s2 . Therefore, force can also be expressed in the unit kgm/s2 . This way of expressing force can be substituted for newtons in the solution to the problem: a= 2 N 2 kg  m/s2 = = 2 m/s2 kg kg Why are there no kilograms in the final answer to this problem? The kilogram units in the numerator and denominator of the fraction cancel out. As a result, the answer is expressed in the correct units for acceleration: m/s2 . You Try It! Problem: Assume that you add the weights to the trunk in Figure 14.7. If you push the trunk and weights with a force of 20 N, what will be the trunks acceleration? Need more practice?

        <p>FIGURE 14.7 This empty trunk has a mass of 10 kilo- grams. The weights also have a mass of 10 kilograms. If the weights are placed in the trunk, what will be its mass? How will this affect its acceleration?</p>

        <h3>Acceleration and Weight</h3>
        <p>Newtons second law of motion explains the weight of objects. Weight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling on an object of a given mass. Its the force (F) in the acceleration equation that was introduced above: a= F m This equation can also be written as: F = ma The acceleration due to gravity of an object equals 9.8 m/s2 , so if you know the mass of an object, you can calculate its weight as: F = m  9.8 m/s2 As this equation shows, weight is directly related to mass. As an objects mass increases, so does its weight. For example, if mass doubles, weight doubles as well. You can learn more about weight and acceleration at this URL: Problem Solving Problem: Daisy has a mass of 35 kilograms. How much does she weigh? Solution: Use the formula: F = m  9.8 m/s2 . F = 35 kg  9.8 m/s2 = 343.0 kg  m/s2 = 343.0 N You Try It! Problem: Daisys dad has a mass is 70 kg, which is twice Daisys mass. Predict how much Daisys dad weighs. Then calculate his weight to see if your prediction is correct. Helpful Hints The equation for calculating weight (F = m  a) works only when the correct units of measurement are used. Mass must be in kilograms (kg). Acceleration must be in m/s2 . Weight (F) is expressed in kgm/s2 or in newtons (N). </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>A cars gas pedal, like the one in Figure 14.5, is sometimes called the accelerator. Thats because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force. </p>
