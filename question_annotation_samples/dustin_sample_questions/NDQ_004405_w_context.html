        <h3>Effusive Eruptions</h3>
        <p>Mafic magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. Although the pressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt with the same explosive force as felsic magma. Magma pushes toward the surface through fissures. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent (Figure 1.1). Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic. In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock. A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here: </p>

        <h3>Types of Lava</h3>
        <p>Low-viscosity lava flows down mountainsides. Differences in composition and where the lavas erupt result in three types of lava flow coming from effusive eruptions. Aa lava forms a thick and brittle crust that is torn into rough and jagged pieces. Aa lava can spread over large areas as the lava continues to flow underneath the crusts surface. Pahoehoe lava forms lava tubes where fluid lava flows through the outer cooled rock crust. Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava, so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. Mafic lava that erupts underwater creates pillow lava. The lava cools very quickly, forming roughly spherical rocks. Pillow lava is common at mid-ocean ridges (Figure (a) Aa lava spread over large areas. (b) Pahoehoe lava tubes where at the Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. (c) Pahoehoe lava is less viscous than aa lava so its surface looks is smooth and ropy. (d) Pillow lava. </p>

        <h3>Effusive Eruptions Damage</h3>
        <p>People can usually be evacuated before an effusive eruption, so they are much less deadly. Although effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone, they can be destructive. Even when people know that a lava flow is approaching, there is not much anyone can do to stop it from destroying a building or road (Figure 1.3). </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Mafic magma creates effusive eruptions. The pressure builds but the lava does not explode so violently from the vent. Effusive eruptions cause damage but usually people can be evacuated, so there are few or no fatalities. Mafic magma cools into different types of flows like aa, pahoehoe, and pillow lava. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. Why do mafic lavas flow rather than explode? 2. Compare and contrast aa and pahoehoe lavas. 3. How do pillow lavas form? </p>
