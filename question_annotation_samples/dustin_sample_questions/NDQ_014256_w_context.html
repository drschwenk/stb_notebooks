        <h3>How We Hear</h3>
        <p>Figure 20.7 shows the three main parts of the ear: the outer, middle, and inner ear. It also shows the specific structures in each part. The roles of these structures in hearing are described below and in the animations at these URLS:  (1:43) MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Outer Ear</h3>
        <p>The outer ear includes the pinna, ear canal, and eardrum. The pinna is the only part of the ear that extends outward from the head. Its position and shape make it good at catching sound waves and funneling them into the ear canal. The ear canal is a tube that carries sound waves into the ear. The sound waves travel through the air inside the ear canal to the eardrum. The eardrum is like the head of a drum. Its a thin membrane stretched tight across the end of the ear canal. The eardrum vibrates when sound waves strike it, and it sends the vibrations on to the middle ear. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Middle Ear</h3>
        <p>The middle ear contains three tiny bones (ossicles) called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. If you look at these bones in Figure 20.7, you might notice that they resemble the objects for which they are named. The three bones transmit vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear. They also amplify the vibrations. The arrangement of the three bones allows them to work together as a lever that increases the amplitude of the waves as they pass to the inner ear. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Inner Ear</h3>
        <p>The stirrup passes the amplified sound waves to the inner ear through the oval window (see Figure 20.7). When the oval window vibrates, it causes the cochlea to vibrate as well. The cochlea is a shell-like structure that is full of fluid and lined with nerve cells called hair cells. Each hair cell has tiny hair-like projections, as you can see in Figure and this triggers electrical impulses. The electrical impulses travel to the brain through nerves. Only after the nerve impulses reach the brain do we hear the sound. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Hearing Loss</h3>
        <p>All these structures of the ear must work well for normal hearing. Damage to any of them, through illness or injury, may cause hearing loss. Total hearing loss is called deafness. To learn more about hearing loss, watch the animation at this URL:  (1:39). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Most adults experience at least some hearing loss as they get older. The most common cause is exposure to loud sounds, which damage hair cells. The louder a sound is, the less exposure is needed for damage to occur. Even a single brief exposure to a sound louder than 115 decibels can cause hearing loss. Figure 20.9 shows the relationship between loudness, exposure time, and hearing loss. </p>

        <h3>Preventing Hearing Loss</h3>
        <p>Hearing loss caused by loud sounds is permanent. However, this type of hearing loss can be prevented by protecting the ears from loud sounds. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Who Needs Hearing Protection</h3>
        <p>People who work in jobs that expose them to loud sounds must wear hearing protectors. Examples include construc- tion workers who work around loud machinery for many hours each day (see Figure 20.10). But anyone exposed to loud sounds for longer than the permissible exposure time should wear hearing protectors. Many home and yard chores and even recreational activities are loud enough to cause hearing loss if people are exposed to them for very long. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How Hearing Protectors Work</h3>
        <p>You can see two different types of hearing protectors in Figure 20.11. Earplugs are simple hearing protectors that just muffle sounds by partially blocking all sound waves from entering the ears. This type of hearing protector is suitable for lower noise levels, such as the noise of a lawnmower or snowmobile engine. Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly. This type of hearing protector is recommended for higher noise levels and situations where its important to be able to hear lower-decibel sounds. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. Write a public service announcement warning people of the dangers of loud sounds. Include tips for protecting the ears from loud sounds. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Explain how we hear sound.
Relate loud sounds to hearing loss.
State how hearing can be protected.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The outer ear catches sound waves and funnels them to the middle ear. The middle ear amplifies the sound waves and passes them to the inner ear. The inner ear changes the sound waves to electrical signals. The signals travel to the brain, which interprets the sounds. Loud sounds can cause hearing loss by damaging hair cells in the inner ear. The louder the sounds are, the less exposure is needed to cause hearing loss. Hearing loss due to loud sounds can be prevented by wearing hearing protectors. They reduce the amplitude of sound waves entering the ears. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, you read about loud sounds and their dangers. Rock concerts often produce very loud sounds. Both the screaming fans and the highly amplified musical instruments contribute to the high decibel levels. Playing musical instruments is one way we use sound. Youll read about musical instruments in "Using Sound," the next lesson. How do you think musical instruments produce sound? In other words, how do you think they cause air to vibrate? How do musical instruments change the pitch of sound? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The organ that we use to hear sound is the ear. Almost all the structures in the ear are needed for this purpose. Together, they gather and amplify sound waves and change their energy to electrical signals. The electrical signals travel to the brain, which interprets them as sound. </p>

        <p>1. 2. 3. 4. What is the function of the outer ear? How does the middle ear amplify sound? Describe the structure of the cochlea. State how hair cells detect sound waves. </p>
