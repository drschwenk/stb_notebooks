        <h3>From Fertilization to Birth</h3>
        <p>When a sperm penetrates the cell membrane of an egg, it triggers the egg to complete meiosis. The sperm also undergoes changes. Its tail falls off, and its nucleus fuses with the nucleus of the egg. The resulting cell, called a zygote, contains the diploid number of chromosomes. Half of the chromosomes come from the egg, and half come from the sperm. You can watch the process of fertilization and the development of a baby until birth in this amazing video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Blastocyst</h3>
        <p>The zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, where it will take up residence. As it travels, it divides many times by mitosis. It soon forms a tiny, fluid-filled ball of cells called a blastocyst. The blastocyst has an inner and outer layer of cells, as you can see in Figure 22.5. The inner layer, called the embryoblast, will develop into the new human being. The outer layer, called the trophoblast, will develop into other structures needed to support the new organism. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Implantation</h3>
        <p>The blastocyst continues down the fallopian tube until it reaches the uterus, about 4 or 5 days after fertilization. When the outer cells of the blastocyst contact cells lining the uterus (the endometrium in Figure 22.5), the blastocyst embeds itself in the uterine lining. This process is called implantation. It generally occurs about a week after fertilization. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Embryo</h3>
        <p>After implantation occurs, the blastocyst is called an embryo. The embryonic stage lasts from the end of the first week following fertilization through the end of the eighth week. During this time, the embryo grows in size and becomes more complex. It develops specialized cells and tissues. Most organs also start to form. You can see some of the specific changes that take place during weeks four to eight of the embryonic period in Figure 22.6. By the end of week eight, the embryo is about 30 millimeters (just over 1 inch) in length. It may also have begun to move. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 22.6 Embryonic Development (Weeks 48). Most organs develop in the embryo during weeks 4 through 8. If the embryo is exposed to toxins during this period, the effects are likely to be very damaging. Can you explain why? (Note: the draw- ings of the embryos are not to scale.)</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Fetus</h3>
        <p>From the eighth week following fertilization until birth, the developing human being is called a fetus. Birth typically occurs at about 38 weeks after fertilization, so the fetal period generally lasts about 30 weeks. During this time, the organs complete their development. The fetus also grows rapidly in length and weight. Some of the specific changes that occur during the fetal stage are listed in Figure 22.7. By the 38th week, the fetus is fully developed and ready to be born. A 38-week fetus normally ranges from about 36 to 51 centimeters (1420 inches) in length and weighs between 2.7 and 4.6 kilograms (about 610 pounds). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Placenta and Amniotic Sac</h3>
        <p>The fetus could not grow and develop without oxygen and nutrients from the mother. Wastes from the fetus also must be removed in order for it to survive. The exchange of these substances between the mother and fetus occurs through the placenta. The placenta is a temporary organ that starts to form shortly after implantation. It forms from the trophoblast layer of cells in the blastocyst and from maternal cells in the uterus. The placenta continues to develop and grow to meet the needs of the growing fetus. A fully developed placenta, like the one in Figure 22.8, is made up of a large mass of blood vessels from both mother and fetus. The maternal and fetal vessels are close together but separated by tiny spaces. This allows the mothers and fetuss blood to exchange substances across their capillary walls without the blood actually mixing. The fetus is connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord. This is a long tube that contains two arteries and a vein. Blood from the fetus enters the placenta through the umbilical arteries. It exchanges gases and other substances with the mothers blood. Then it travels back to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Another structure that supports the fetus is the amniotic sac. This is a membrane that surrounds and protects the fetus. It contains amniotic fluid, which consists of water and dissolved substances. The fluid allows the fetus to move freely until it grows to fill most of the available space. The fluid also cushions the fetus and helps protect it from injury. </p>

        <h3>Pregnancy and Birth</h3>
        <p>Pregnancy is the carrying of one or more offspring from the time of implantation until birth. It is the development of an embryo and fetus from the expectant mothers point of view. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Role of the Mother</h3>
        <p>The pregnant mother plays a critical role in the development of the embryo and fetus. She must avoid toxic substances such as alcohol, which can damage the developing offspring. She also must provide all the nutrients and other substances needed for normal growth and development. Most nutrients are needed in greater amounts by a pregnant woman because she is literally eating for two people. Thats why its important for a woman to eat plenty of nutritious foods during pregnancy. The pregnant woman in Figure 22.9 is eating a variety of fresh fruits, which provide energy, vitamins, and other nutrients. </p>

        <h3>Birth</h3>
        <p>Near the time of birth, the amniotic sac breaks in a gush of liquid. Labor usually begins within a day of this event. Labor involves contractions of the muscular walls of the uterus. With the mothers help, the contractions eventually push the fetus out of the uterus and through the vagina. Within seconds of birth, the umbilical cord is cut. Without this connection to the placenta, the baby cant exchange gases, so carbon dioxide quickly builds up in the babys blood. This stimulates the babys brain to trigger breathing, and the newborn takes her first breath. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>From Birth to Adulthood</h3>
        <p>For the first year after birth, a baby is referred to as an infant. Childhood begins at the age of two years and continues until puberty. Adolescence begins with puberty and lasts until adulthood. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Infancy</h3>
        <p>The first year of life after birth is called infancy. During infancy, a baby grows very quickly. The babys length typically doubles and her weight triples by her first birthday. Many other important changes also occur during infancy: The baby starts smiling, usually by about 6 weeks of age (see Figure 22.10). The baby starts noticing people and grabbing toys and other objects The baby teeth start to come in, usually by 6 months of age. The baby begins making babbling sounds. By the end of the first year, the baby may be saying a few words, such as Mama and Dada. The baby learns to sit, crawl, and stand. By the end of the first year, the baby may be starting to walk. </p>

        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>Childhood begins after the babys first birthday and continues until puberty. Between 1 and 3 years of age, a child is called a toddler. During the toddler stage, growth is still very rapid, but not as rapid as it was during infancy. Toddlers learn many new words and starts putting them together in simple sentences. Motor skills also develop quickly during the toddler stage. By the age of 3 years, most children can run and climb steps. They can hold crayons and scribble with them. They can also feed themselves, and most can use the toilet. From age 3 until puberty, growth slows down. The body also changes shape. The arms and legs grow longer relative to the trunk. Children continue to develop new motor skills. For example, many young children learn how to ride a tricycle and then a bicycle. Most learn how to play games and sports. By the age of 6 years, children start losing their baby teeth. Permanent teeth come in to replace them. Most children have started school by this age. They typically start learning to read and write around age 6 or 7 (see Figure 22.11). During the later years of childhood, children also start to develop friendships and become less dependent on their parents. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Puberty</h3>
        <p>Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls and from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys. In both girls and boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland signals the gonads (ovaries or testes) to start secreting sex hormones (estrogen in girls, testosterone in boys). Sex hormones, in turn, cause many other changes to take place. In girls, estrogen causes the following changes to occur: The uterus and ovaries grow. The ovaries start releasing eggs. The menstrual cycle begins. Pubic hair grows. The hips widen and the breasts develop. In boys, testosterone causes these changes to take place: The penis and testes grow. The testes start producing sperm. Pubic and facial hair grow. The shoulders broaden. The voice becomes deeper as the larynx in the throat grows larger (see Figure 22.12). Girls and boys of the same age are similar in height during childhood. In both girls and boys, growth in height and weight is very fast during puberty. But boys grow more quickly that girls do, and their period of rapid growth also lasts longer. In addition, boys generally start puberty later than girls, so they have a longer period of childhood growth. For all these reasons, by the end of puberty, the average height of boys is 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) greater than the average height of girls. </p>

        <h3>Adolescence</h3>
        <p>Adolescence is the stage of life between the start of puberty and the beginning of adulthood. Adolescence begins with the physical changes of puberty. It also includes many other changes, including mental, emotional, and social changes. During adolescence: Teens develop new thinking abilities. For example, they develop the ability to understand abstract ideas, such as honesty and freedom. Their ability to think logically also improves. They usually get better at problem solving as well. Teens try to establish a sense of identity. They typically become increasingly independent from their parents. Many teens have emotional ups and downs. This is at least partly due to their changing hormone levels. Teens usually start spending more time with their peers, like the girls in Figure 22.13. Adolescents usually spend much more time with their friends and classmates than they do with family members. </p>

        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
        <p>Adulthood doesnt have a definite starting point. Teens may become physically mature by the age 16 years, but they are not adults in a legal sense until they are older. For example, in the U.S., you must be 18 years old to vote or serve in the armed forces. You must be 21 years old before you can take on many legal and financial responsibilities. Once adulthood begins, it can be divided into three stages: early, middle, and late adulthood. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Early Adulthood</h3>
        <p>Early adulthood refers to the 20s and early 30s. During early adulthood, most people are at their physical peak, and they are usually in good health. Often, they are completing their education and getting established in the workforce. Many people become engaged or marry during this time. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Middle Adulthood</h3>
        <p>Middle adulthood is the period from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, people start showing signs of aging. Their hair may thin and slowly turn gray. Their skin develops wrinkles. The risk of serious health problems increases. For example, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and type 2 diabetes become more common in people of middle age. This is also the stage when many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Late Adulthood</h3>
        <p>Late adulthood begins in the mid-60s and continues until death. This is the stage of life when most people retire from work. This frees up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, or other interests. For example, the man in Figure During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesnt work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimers disease. Despite problems such as these, many people remain healthy and active into their 80s and even 90s. Do you want </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Fertilization of an egg by a sperm in a fallopian tube produces a zygote. The zygote develops into a blastocyst, which implants in the uterus. The offspring then goes through the embryonic and fetal stages. The placenta supports the needs of the developing embryo and fetus. Birth generally occurs at about 38 months after fertilization. An expectant mother must avoid toxins to protect the developing fetus. She also must eat a nutritious diet during pregnancy for the health of her child. For the first year after birth, a baby is referred to as an infant. Childhood begins at the age of two years and continues until puberty, when sexual maturation takes place. Adolescence is the last stage of life before adulthood. It starts with puberty and ends around age 20. Stages of adulthood include early, middle, and late adulthood. Each stage is associated with different physical abilities, health concerns, and social roles. </p>
