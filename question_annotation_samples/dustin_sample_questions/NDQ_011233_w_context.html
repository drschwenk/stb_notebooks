        <h3>What are Insects</h3>
        <p>Insects, with over a million described species, are the most diverse group of animals on Earth. They may be found in nearly all environments on the planet. No matter where you travel, you will see organisms from this group. Adult insects range in size from a minuscule fairy fly to a 21.9-inch-long stick insect ( Figure 1.1). </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Characteristics of Insects</h3>
        <p>Characteristics of Insects include: Segmented bodies with an exoskeleton. The outer layer of the exoskeleton is called the cuticle. It is made up of two layers. The outer layer, or exocuticle, is thin, waxy, and water-resistant. The inner layer is much thicker. The exocuticle is extremely thin in many soft-bodied insects, such as caterpillars. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct but joined units: a head, a thorax, and an abdomen ( Figure 1.2 and Table 1.1). A diagram of a human and an insect, com- paring the three main body parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Structure Head Thorax Abdomen Description A pair of antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and three sets of appendages that form the mouthparts. Six segmented legs and two or four wings. Contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive structures. A nervous system that is divided into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. Respiration that occurs without lungs. Insects have a system of internal tubes and sacs that oxygen travels through to reach body tissues. Air is taken in through the spiracles, openings on the sides of the abdomen. A closed digestive system, with one long enclosed coiled tube which runs lengthwise through the body, from the mouth to the anus. A circulatory system that is simple and consists of only a single tube with openings. The tube pulses and circulates blood-like fluids inside the body cavity. Various types of movement. Insect movement can include flight, walking, and swimming. Insects were the Fireflies Reproduction and predation: Some species produce flashes to attract mates; other species to attract prey. Sound Production By moving appendages Cicadas Ultrasound clicks Moths Loudest sounds among insects; have special muscles to produce sounds. Predation: Produced mostly by moths to warn bats. Chemical Wide range of insects have evolved chemical communication; chemi- cals are used to attract, repel, or provide other kinds of information; use of scents is especially well de- veloped in social insects. Dance Language Moths Honey bees Antennae of males ( Figure 1.4) can detect pheromones (chemicals released by animals that influence the behavior of others within the same species) of female moths over distances of many miles. Honey bees are the only inverte- brates to have evolved this type of communication; length of dance represents distance to be flown. </p>

        <h3>Insects are Social</h3>
        <p>Social insects, such as termites, ants, and many bees and wasps ( Figure 1.5), are the most familiar social species. They live together in large, well-organized colonies. Only those insects which live in nests or colonies can home. Homing means that an insect can return to a single hole among many other apparently identical holes, even after a long trip or after a long time. A few insects migrate in groups. For example, the monarch butterfly flies between Mexico and North America each spring and fall ( Figure 1.5). (left) Damage to this nest brings the work- ers and soldiers of this social insect, the termite, to repair it. (center ) A wasp build- ing its nest.

        <h3>Two Major Groups of Insects</h3>
        <p>Insects are divided into two major groups: 1. Wingless: Consists of two orders, the bristle tails and the silverfish. 2. Winged insects: All other orders of insects. They are named below. Mayflies; dragonflies and damselflies; stoneflies; webspinners; angel insects; earwigs; grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids; stick insects; ice-crawlers and gladiators; cockroaches and termites; mantids; lice; thrips; true bugs, aphids, and cicadas; wasps, bees, and ants; beetles; twisted-winged parasites; snakeflies; alderflies and dobsonflies; lacewings and antlions; hangingflies (including fleas); true flies; caddisflies; and butterflies, moths, and skippers. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Characteristics of insects include segmented bodies, a system of internal tubes and sacs through which oxygen travels, and a simple circulatory system. Insects use many types of communication, including bioluminescence, sounds, and phermones. Some insects are social and live in groups. </p>
