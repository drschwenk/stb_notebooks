        <h3>Puberty and Adolescence</h3>
        <p>Puberty is the stage of life when a child becomes sexually mature. Puberty lasts from about 12 to 18 years of age in boys and from about 10 to 16 years of age in girls. The age when puberty begins is different from one child to another. Children that begin puberty much earlier or later than their peers may feel self-conscious. They may also worry that something is wrong with them. Usually, an early or late puberty is perfectly normal. In boys, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the testes to secrete testosterone. Testosterone causes the following to happen: 1. 2. 3. 4. The penis and testes grow. The testes start making sperm. Pubic and facial hair grow. The shoulders broaden, and the voice becomes deeper. In girls, puberty begins when the pituitary gland tells the ovaries to secrete estrogen. Estrogen causes the following to happen: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The uterus and ovaries grow. The ovaries start releasing eggs. The menstrual cycle begins. Pubic hair grows. The hips widen, and the breasts develop. Boys and girls are close to the same height during childhood. In both boys and girls, growth in height and weight is very fast during puberty. But boys grow faster than girls during puberty. Their period of fast growth also lasts longer.
