        <h3>Chromosomal Disorders</h3>
        <p>Some children are born with genetic defects that are not carried by a single gene. Instead, an error in a larger part of the chromosome or even in an entire chromosome causes the disorder. Usually the error happens when the egg or sperm is forming. Having extra chromosomes or damaged chromosomes can cause disorders. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Extra Chromosomes</h3>
        <p>One common example of an extra-chromosome disorder is Down syndrome ( Figure 1.1). Children with Down syndrome are mentally disabled and also have physical deformities. Down syndrome occurs when a baby receives an extra chromosome 21 from one of his or her parents. Usually, a child will receive one chromosome 21 from the mother and one chromosome 21 from the father. In an individual with Down syndrome, however, there are three Chromosomes of a person with Down Syndrome. Notice the extra chromosome 21. copies of chromosome 21 ( Figure 1.2). Therefore, Down syndrome is also known as Trisomy 21. These people have 47 total chromosomes. Another example of a chromosomal disorder is Klinefelter syndrome, in which a male inherits an extra X chromosome. These individuals have an XXY genotype. They have underdeveloped sex organs and elongated limbs. They also have difficulty learning new things. </p>

        <p>FIGURE 1.2 Outside of chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes, most embryos with extra chromosomes do not usually survive. Because chromosomes carry many, many genes, a disruption of a chromosome can cause severe problems with the development of a fetus. Individuals with one (or more) fewer chromosome usually dont survive either. Can you explain why?</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Damaged Chromosomes</h3>
        <p>Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged. For example, if a tiny portion of chromosome 5 is missing, the individual will have cri du chat (cats cry) syndrome. These individuals have misshapen facial features, and the infants cry resembles a cats cry. </p>

        <p>Changes in chromosome number can lead to disorders like Down syndrome. Chromosomal disorders also occur when part of a chromosome becomes damaged. </p>
