        <h3>How Society Can Conserve Water</h3>
        <p>Water consumption per person has been going down for the past few decades. There are many ways that water conservation can be encouraged. Charging more for water gives a financial incentive for careful water use. Water use may be restricted by time of day, season, or activity. Good behavior can be encouraged; for example, people can be given an incentive to replace grass with desert plants in arid regions. </p>

        <h3>How You Can Conserve Water</h3>
        <p>As human population growth continues, water conservation will become increasingly important globally, especially in developed countries where people use an enormous amount of water. What are some of the ways you can conserve water in and around your home? Avoid polluting water so that less is needed. Convert to more efficient irrigation methods on farms and in gardens. Reduce household demand by installing water-saving devices such as low-flow shower heads and toilets. Reduce personal demand by turning off the tap when water is not being used and taking shorter showers. Engage in water-saving practices: for instance, water lawns less and sweep rather than hose down sidewalks. At Earth Summit 2002, many governments approved a Plan of Action to address the scarcity of water and safe drinking water in developing countries. One goal of this plan was to cut in half the number of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015. Although this is a very important goal, it will not be met. Goals like these are made more difficult as population continues to grow. This colorful adobe house in Tucson, Arizona is surrounded by native cactus, which needs little water to thrive.
