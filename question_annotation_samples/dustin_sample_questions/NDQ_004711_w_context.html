        <h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>
        <p>The exception to Earths temperature being in balance is caused by greenhouse gases. But first the role of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be explained. Greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere by trapping heat. Some of the heat that radiates out from the ground is trapped by greenhouse gases in the troposphere. Like a blanket on a sleeping person, greenhouse gases act as insulation for the planet. The warming of the atmosphere because of insulation by greenhouse gases is called the greenhouse effect (Figure 1.1). Greenhouse gases are the component of the atmosphere that moderate Earths temperatures. </p>

        <h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
        <p>Greenhouse gases include CO2 , H2 O, methane, O3 , nitrous oxides (NO and NO2 ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). All are a normal part of the atmosphere except CFCs. Table 1.1 shows how each greenhouse gas naturally enters the atmosphere. Greenhouse Gas Carbon dioxide Methane Nitrous oxide Ozone Chlorofluorocarbons Where It Comes From Respiration, volcanic eruptions, decomposition of plant material; burning of fossil fuels Decomposition of plant material under some condi- tions, biochemical reactions in stomachs Produced by bacteria Atmospheric processes Not naturally occurring; made by humans Different greenhouse gases have different abilities to trap heat. For example, one methane molecule traps 23 times as much heat as one CO2 molecule. One CFC-12 molecule (a type of CFC) traps 10,600 times as much heat as one CO2 . Still, CO2 is a very important greenhouse gas because it is much more abundant in the atmosphere. </p>

        <h3>Human Activity and Greenhouse Gas Levels</h3>
        <p>Human activity has significantly raised the levels of many of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Methane levels are about 2 1/2 times higher as a result of human activity. Carbon dioxide has increased more than 35%. CFCs have only recently existed. What do you think happens as atmospheric greenhouse gas levels increase? More greenhouse gases trap more heat and warm the atmosphere. The increase or decrease of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere affect climate and weather the world over.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Greenhouse gases include CO2 , H2 O, methane, O3 , nitrous oxides (NO and NO2 ), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Tropospheric greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere; greenhouse gases vary in their heat-trapping abilities. Levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing due to human activities. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. If you were trying to keep down global temperature and you had a choice between adding 100 methane molecules or 1 CFC-12 molecule to the atmosphere, which would you choose and why? 2. What is the greenhouse effect? 3. How does Earths atmosphere resemble a greenhouse? </p>
