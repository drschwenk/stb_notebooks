        <h3>Mesosphere</h3>
        <p>Above the stratosphere is the mesosphere. Temperatures in the mesosphere decrease with altitude. Because there are few gas molecules in the mesosphere to absorb the Suns radiation, the heat source is the stratosphere below. The mesosphere is extremely cold, especially at its top, about -90o C (-130o F). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Air Density</h3>
        <p>The air in the mesosphere has extremely low density: 99.9% of the mass of the atmosphere is below the mesosphere. As a result, air pressure is very low (Figure 1.1). A person traveling through the mesosphere would experience severe burns from ultraviolet light since the ozone layer, which provides UV protection, is in the stratosphere below. There would be almost no oxygen for breathing. And, of course, your blood would boil at normal body temperature. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The mesosphere has a very low density of gas molecules. Temperature decreases in the mesosphere with altitude because the heat source is the stratosphere. The mesosphere is no place for human life! </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. Why would a person get severe burns in the mesosphere? 2. Why would a persons blood boil in the mesosphere? 3. How can meteors burn in the mesosphere when the air density is so low? </p>
