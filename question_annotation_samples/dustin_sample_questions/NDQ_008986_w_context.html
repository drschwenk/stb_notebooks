        <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the variation in living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the range of communities and ecosystems in which they live. Scientists have identified about 1.9 million species alive today, but they are discovering new species all the time. How many species actually exist in the world? No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered. Estimates range from 5 to 30 million total species currently in existence. Many of them live on coral reefs and in tropical rainforests (see Figure 25.14). These two ecosystems have some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Importance of Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>Biodiversity is important to human beings for many reasons. For one thing, biodiversity has direct economic benefits. Here are a few of the economic benefits of biodiversity: Besides food, diverse living things provide us with many different products. Some examples include dyes, rubber, fibers, paper, adhesives, and timber. Living things are an invaluable source of medical drugs. More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species. However, only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential. Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to toxins be- cause of their permeable skin. Their current high rates of extinction serve as an early warning of environmental damage and danger to us all. Wild organisms maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation. This is important because most domestic species have been bred to be genetically uniform. This puts domestic crops and animals at great risk of dying out due to disease. Some living things provide inspiration for technology. For example, water strider insects like the one in Figure water quality, among other useful purposes. </p>

        <h3>Ecosystem Services</h3>
        <p>Biodiversity is important for healthy ecosystems. It generally increases ecosystem productivity and stability. It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change. Biodiversity also provides many other ecosystem services. For example: Plants and algae maintain Earths atmosphere. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide when they undertake photosynthesis. Plants help protect the soil. Their roots grip the soil and keep it from washing or blowing away. When plants die, their organic matter improves the soil as it decomposes. Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also decompose organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. Certain bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Predator species such as birds and spiders control insect pests. They reduce the need for chemical pesticides, which are expensive and may be harmful to human beings and other organisms. Animals, like the bee in Figure below, pollinate flowering plants. Many crop plants depend on pollination by wild animals. </p>

        <h3>Extinction</h3>
        <p>Extinction is the complete dying out of a species. Once a species goes extinct, it can never return. More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Sixth Mass Extinction</h3>
        <p>Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is happening right now. Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out. Dozens of species are going extinct every day. If this rate continues, as many as half of all remaining species could go extinct by 2050. Why are so many species going extinct today? Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth mass extinction is due mainly to human actions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
        <p>The single biggest cause of the sixth mass extinction is habitat loss. A habitat is the area where a species lives and to which it has become adapted. When a habitat is disturbed or destroyed, it threatens all the species that live there with extinction. More than half of Earths land area has been disturbed or destroyed by farming, mining, forestry, or the development of cities, suburbs, and golf courses. Habitats that are rapidly being destroyed include tropical rainforests. They are being cut and burned, mainly to clear the land for farming. Half of Earths mature tropical forests have already been destroyed. At current rates of destruction, they will all be gone by 2090. In the U.S., half of the wetlands and almost all of the tall-grass prairies (see Figure 25.17) have already been destroyed for farming. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Other Causes of Extinction</h3>
        <p>There are several other causes of the sixth mass extinction. Most of them contribute to habitat destruction. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the greenhouse effect and caused global climate change. Increasing temperatures are changing basic climate factors of habitats, and rising sea levels are covering them with water. These changes threaten many species. Pollution of air, water, and soil makes habitats toxic to many organisms. A well-known example is the near extinction of the peregrine falcon in the mid-1900s due to the pesticide DDT. Humans have over-harvested trees, fish, and other wild species. This threatens not only their survival but the survival of all the other species that depend on them. Humans have introduced exotic species into new habitats. These are species that are not native to the habitat where they are introduced. They may lack predators in the new habitat so they can out-compete native species and drive them extinct. Exotic species may also carry new diseases, prey on native species, and disrupt local food webs. You can read about an example of an exotic species in Figure 25.18. </p>

It also blocks irrigation systems.</p>

        <h3>Protecting Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>Government policies and laws are needed to protect biodiversity. Such actions have been shown to work in the past. For example, peregrine falcons made an incredible recovery after laws were passed banning the use of DDT. Individuals can also play a role in protecting biodiversity. What can you do? Here are a few suggestions: Start a compost pile to recycle organic wastes. Use the compost to enrich yard and garden soil. It will reduce the need for chemical fertilizers and added water. Make your backyard welcoming to native wildlife. Plant native plants that will provide food and shelter for native animals such as birds and amphibians. Add a water source, such as a fountain or bird bath. Avoid the introduction of exotic species to local habitats. Avoid the use of herbicides and pesticides. In addition to killing garden weeds and pests, they may harm native organisms, such as wildflowers, honey bees, and song birds. Conserve natural resources, including energy resources. Always reduce, reuse, or recycle. Learn more about biodiversity and how to protect it. Then pass on what you learn to others. </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Its obvious that living things are important natural resources needed by human beings. After all, other species provide us with all of the food we eat. We couldnt survive without them. But thats far from the only reason that other species are important for human survival. Biodiversity is an important natural resource in and of itself. </p>
