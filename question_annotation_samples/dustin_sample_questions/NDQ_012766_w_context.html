        <h3>Acids</h3>
        <p>An acid is an ionic compound that produces positive hydrogen ions (H+ ) when dissolved in water. An example is hydrogen chloride (HCl). When it dissolves in water, its hydrogen ions and negative chloride ions (Cl ) separate, forming hydrochloric acid. This can be represented by the equation: HCl H2 O + ! H + Cl </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Properties of Acids</h3>
        <p>You already know that a sour taste is one property of acids. (Never taste an unknown substance to see whether it is an acid!) Acids have certain other properties as well. For example, acids can conduct electricity because they consist of charged particles in solution. Acids also react with metals to produce hydrogen gas. For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with the metal magnesium (Mg), it produces magnesium chloride (MgCl2 ) and hydrogen (H2 ). This is a single replacement reaction, represented by the chemical equation: Mg + 2HCl ! H2 + MgCl2 You can see an online demonstration of a similar reaction at this URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Detecting Acids</h3>
        <p>Certain compounds, called indicators, change color when acids come into contact with them. They can be used to detect acids. An example of an indicator is a compound called litmus. It is placed on small strips of paper that may be red or blue. If you place a few drops of acid on a strip of blue litmus paper, the paper will turn red. You can see this in Figure 10.6. Litmus isnt the only indicator for detecting acids. Red cabbage juice also works well, as you can see in this entertaining video:  . </p>

        <h3>Uses of Acids</h3>
        <p>Acids have many important uses, especially in industry. For example, sulfuric acid is used to manufacture a variety of different products, including paper, paint, and detergent. Some other uses of acids are illustrated in Figure 10.7. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Bases</h3>
        <p>A base is an ionic compound that produces negative hydroxide ions (OH ) when dissolved in water. For example, when the compound sodium hydroxide (NaOH) dissolves in water, it produces hydroxide ions and positive sodium ions (Na+ ). This can be represented by the equation: NaOH H2 O ! OH + Na+ </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Properties of Bases</h3>
        <p>All bases share certain properties, including a bitter taste. (Never taste an unknown substance to see whether it is a base!) Did you ever taste unsweetened cocoa powder? It tastes bitter because it is a base. Bases also feel slippery. Think about how slippery soap feels. Soap is also a base. Like acids, bases conduct electricity because they consist of charged particles in solution. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Detecting Bases</h3>
        <p>Bases change the color of certain compounds, and this property can be used to detect them. A common indicator of bases is red litmus paper. Bases turn red litmus paper blue. You can see an example in Figure 10.8. Red cabbage juice can detect bases as well as acids, as youll see by reviewing this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Uses of Bases</h3>
        <p>Bases are used for a variety of purposes. For example, soaps contain bases such as potassium hydroxide. Other uses of bases are pictured in Figure 10.9. </p>

        <h3>Strength of Acids and Bases</h3>
        <p>The acid in vinegar is weak enough to safely eat on a salad. The acid in a car battery is strong enough to eat through skin. The base in antacid tablets is weak enough to take for an upset stomach. The base in drain cleaner is strong enough to cause serious burns. What causes these differences in strength of acids and bases? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Concentration of Ions</h3>
        <p>The strength of an acid depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions it produces when dissolved in water. A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid. For example, when hydrogen chloride is added to water, all of it breaks down into H+ and Cl ions. Therefore, it is a strong acid. On the other hand, only about 1 percent of acetic acid breaks down into ions, so it is a weak acid. The strength of a base depends on the concentration of hydroxide ions it produces when dissolved in water. For example, sodium hydroxide completely breaks down into ions in water, so it is a strong base. However, only a fraction of ammonia breaks down into ions, so it is a weak base. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The pH Scale</h3>
        <p>The strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale (see Figure 10.10). The symbol pH represents acidity, or the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+ ) in a solution. Pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7. With a higher concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic but has a lower pH. Therefore, acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH close to zero. Bases have a pH greater than 7, and the strongest bases have a pH close to 14. You can watch a video about the pH scale at this URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Why pH Matters</h3>
        <p>Acidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7. Fish also need a pH close to 7. Some air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acid fog and acid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower (see Figure 10.10). Figure 10.11 shows the effects of acid fog and acid rain on a forest. Acid rain also lowers the pH of surface waters such as streams and lakes. As a result, the water became too acidic for fish and many other water organisms to survive. Even normal (not acid) rain is slightly acidic. Thats because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in raindrops, producing a weak acid called carbonic acid. When acidic rainwater soaks into the ground, it can slowly dissolve rocks, particularly those containing calcium carbonate. This is how water forms caves, like the one that opened this chapter. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Reactions of Acids and Bases</h3>
        <p>As you read above, an acid produces positive hydrogen ions and a base produces negative hydroxide ions. If an acid and base react together, the hydrogen and hydroxide ions combine to form water. This is represented by the equation: H+ + OH ! H2 O An acid also produces negative ions, and a base also produces positive ions. For example, the acid hydrogen chloride (HCl), when dissolved in water, produces negative chloride ions (Cl ) as well as hydrogen ions. The base sodium hydroxide (NaOH) produces positive sodium ions (Na+ ) in addition to hydroxide ions. These other ions also combine when the acid and base react. They form sodium chloride (NaCl). This is represented by the equation: Na+ + Cl ! NaCl Sodium chloride is called table salt, but salt is a more general term. A salt is any ionic compound that forms when an acid and base react. It consists of a positive ion from the base and a negative ion from the acid. Like pure water, a salt is neutral in pH. Thats why reactions of acids and bases are called neutralization reactions. Another example of a neutralization reaction is described in Figure 10.12. You can learn more about salts and how they form at this URL:  (13:21). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>An acid is an ionic compound that produces positive hydrogen ions when dissolved in water. Acids taste sour and turn blue litmus paper red. A base is an ionic compound that produces negative hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. Bases taste bitter and turn red litmus paper blue. The strength of acids and bases is determined by the concentration of ions they produce when dissolved in water. The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is called acidity. It is measured by pH. A neutral substance has a pH of 7. An acid has a pH lower than 7, and a base has a pH greater than 7. The reaction of an acid and a base is called a neutralization reaction. It produces a salt and water, both of which are neutral. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Neutralization reactions, like the other chemical reactions you have read about so far, involve electrons. Electrons are outside the nucleus of an atom. Certain other reactions involve the nucleus of an atom instead. These reactions are called nuclear reactions. You will read about them in the next chapter, "Nuclear Chemistry." How do you think nuclear reactions might differ from chemical reactions? Elements involved in nuclear reactions are radioactive. How do you think radioactive elements differ from other elements? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>No doubt you are familiar with some common acids. Besides orange juice, vinegar and lemon juice are both acids. Look at the boy in Figure 10.5. You can tell by the expression on his face that lemon juice tastes sour. In fact, all acids taste sour. They share certain other properties as well. You will learn more about their properties in this lesson. For a musical rendition of lesson content, go to this URL:  . </p>
