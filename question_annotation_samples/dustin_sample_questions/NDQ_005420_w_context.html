        <h3>Testing Hypotheses</h3>
        <p>If we were doing a scientific investigation we need to gather the information to test the hypotheses ourselves. We would do this by making observations or running experiments. </p>

        <h3>Observations</h3>
        <p>Observations of Earths surface may be made from the land surface or from space. Many important observations are made by orbiting satellites, which have a birds eye view of how the planet is changing (for example, see Figure Often, observation is used to collect data when it is not possible for practical or ethical reasons to perform experi- ments. Scientists may send devices to make observations for them when it is too dangerous or impractical for them to make the observations directly. They may use microscopes to explore tiny objects or telescopes to learn about the universe (see Figure 1.2). Artists concept of the Juno orbiter circling Jupiter. The mission is ongoing. </p>

        <h3>Experiments</h3>
        <p>Answering some questions requires experiments. An experiment is a test that may be performed in the field or in a laboratory. An experiment must always done under controlled conditions. The goal of an experiment is to verify or falsify a hypothesis. In an experiment, it is important to change only one factor. All other factors must be kept the same. Independent variable: The factor that will be manipulated. Dependent variable: The factors that depend on the independent variable. An experiment must have a control group. The control group is not subjected to the independent variable. For example, if you want to test if Vitamin C prevents colds, you must divide your sample group up so that some receive Vitamin C and some do not. Those who do not receive the Vitamin C are the control group. </p>

        <h3>Experimental Error</h3>
        <p>Scientists often make many measurements during experiments. As in just about every human endeavor, errors are unavoidable. In a scientific experiment, this is called experimental error. Systematic errors are part of the experimental setup, so that the numbers are always skewed in one direction. For example, a scale may always measure one-half of an ounce high. Random errors occur because a measurement is not made precisely. For example, a stopwatch may be stopped too soon or too late. To correct for this, many measurements are taken and then averaged. Experiments always have a margin of error associated with them. In an experiment, if a result is inconsistent with the results from other samples and many tests have been done, it is likely that a mistake was made in that experiment. The inconsistent data point can be thrown out. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Testing a hypothesis requires data. Data can be gathered by observations or by experiments. Observations can be done simply by looking at and measuring a phenomenon, or by using advanced technol- ogy. Experiments must be well-designed. They must be done under controlled conditions and with the manipulation of only one variable. Guidelines must be followed when dealing with possible experimental errors. </p>

        <h3>Review</h3>
        <p>1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Under what circumstances would a scientist test a hypothesis using observations? Under what circumstances would a scientist test a hypothesis using experiments? What is a control group in an experiment? What is the difference between an independent and a dependent variable in an experiment? An experiment is done on 90 people to test their vitamin D levels: 30 are given vitamin D tablets, 30 are told to spend 15 minutes in the sun each day and 30 are kept inside and not given any supplements. What is the control group? What is the dependent variable? What is the independent variable? </p>
