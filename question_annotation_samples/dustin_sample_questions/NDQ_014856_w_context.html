        <h3>Discovery of Electromagnetism</h3>
        <p>In 1820, a physicist in Denmark, named Hans Christian Oersted, discovered how electric currents and magnetic fields are related. However, it was just a lucky accident. Oersted, who is pictured in Figure 25.1, was presenting a demonstration to his students. Ironically, he was trying to show that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a magnet, and nothing happened. After class, a student held the wire near the magnet again, but in a different direction. To Oersteds surprise, the pointer of the magnet swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing to Earths magnetic north pole. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the magnet. The pointer swung back to its original position, pointing north again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the pointer of the nearby compass. Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a current, so he placed a magnet at different locations around a wire with current flowing through it. You can see some of his results in Figure 25.2. They show that the magnetic field created by a current has field lines that circle around the wire. You can learn more about Oersteds investigations of current and magnetism at the URL below. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields</h3>
        <p>The magnetic field created by a current flowing through a wire actually surrounds the wire in concentric circles. This magnetic field is stronger if more current is flowing through the wire. The direction of the magnetic field also depends on the direction that the current is flowing through the wire. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The right hand rule is illustrated in Figure 25.3. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field. You can see the right hand rule in action at this URL:  . </p>

        <p>4. The drawing below shows part of a wire that has current flowing through it. The arrow shows the direction of the current. Apply the right hand rule, and sketch the magnetic field lines around the wire. </p>

        <p>Outline how electromagnetism was discovered.
Describe the magnetic field created by an electric current.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. Electromagnetism was discovered by Oersted in 1820. The magnetic field produced by a current in a wire moves around the wire in concentric circles. More current creates a stronger magnetic field, and the direction of the current determines the direction of the magnetic field. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The magnetic field created by a single wire with current flowing through it is too weak to be very useful. However, technologies have been developed to make stronger electromagnetic fields. You can learn what they are in the next lesson on "Using Electromagnetism." What might make an electromagnetic field stronger? How might the wire that carries the current be arranged to increase the strength of the magnetic field? </p>

        <p>The crane magnet in the opening photo is an electromagnet. Like all electromagnets, its magnetism is produced by electric current. This type of magnetism is called electromagnetism. </p>
