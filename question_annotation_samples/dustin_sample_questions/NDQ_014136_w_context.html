        <h3>Measuring</h3>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of measuring is the system of units used for measurement. Remember the Mars Climate Orbiter that opened this chapter? It shows clearly why a single system of measurement units is needed in science. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using SI Units</h3>
        <p>The measurement system used by most scientists is the International System of Units, or SI. Table 2.2 lists common units in this system. SI is easy to use because everything is based on the number 10. Basic units are multiplied or divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger or smaller units. Prefixes are added to the names of the basic units to indicate the powers of ten. For example, the meter is the basic unit of length. The prefix kilo- means 1000, so a kilometer is 1000 meters. Can you infer what the other prefixes in the table mean? If not, you can find out at this URL: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html . Variable Length Volume Mass Basic SI Unit (English Equivalent) meter (m) (1 m = 39.37 in) cubic meter (m3 ) (1 m3 = 1.3 yd3 ) gram (g) (1 g = 0.04 oz) Related SI Units Equivalent Units kilometer (km) decimeter (dm) centimeter (cm) millimeter (mm) micrometer (m) nanometer (nm) liter (L) milliliter (mL) kilogram (kg) milligram (mg) = 1000 m = 0.1 m = 0.01 m = 0.001 m = 0.000001 m = 0.000000001 m = 1 dm3 = 1 cm3 = 1000 g = 0.001 g The SI system has units for other variables in addition to the three shown here in Table 2.2. Some of these other units are introduced in later chapters. Problem Solving Problem: Use information in Table 2.2 to convert 3 meters to inches. Solution: 3 m = 3  39.37 in = 118.11 in You Try It! Problem: Rod needs to buy 1 m of wire for a science experiment. The wire is sold by the yard, not the meter. If he buys 1 yd of wire, will he have enough? (Hint: How many inches are there in 1 yd? In 1 m?) </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Measuring Temperature</h3>
        <p>The SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale. However, some scientists use the Celsius scale instead. If you live in the U.S., you are probably more familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. Table 2.3 compares all three temperature scales. What is the difference between the boiling and freezing points of water on each of these scales? Scale Kelvin Celsius Fahrenheit Freezing Point of Water 273 K 0C 32F Boiling Point of Water 373 K 100C 212F Each 1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale. This makes it easy to convert measurements between Kelvin and Celsius. For example, to go from Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273. How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius? Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The following conversion factors are used: Celsius ! Fahrenheit : ( C  1.8) + 32 = F Fahrenheit ! Celsius : ( F 32)  1.8 = C Problem Solving Problem: Convert 10C to Fahrenheit. Solution: (10C  1.8) + 32 = 50F You Try It! Problem: The weather forecaster predicts a high temperature today of 86F. What will the temperature be in Celsius? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Measuring Devices</h3>
        <p>Measuring devices must be used correctly to get accurate measurements. Figure 2.6 shows the correct way to use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid. Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure liquids: Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding liquid. Move so your eyes are at the same level as the top of the liquid in the cylinder. Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved surface of the liquid. This is called the meniscus. At the URLs below, you can see the correct way to use a metric ruler to measure length and a beam balance to measure mass.  (beam balance) (5:14) </p>

        <p>FIGURE 2.6 This cylinder contains about 66 mL of liquid. What would the measure- ment be if you read the top of the meniscus by mistake? MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: https://www.ck12.org/flx/render/embeddedobject/5036</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Accuracy and Precision</h3>
        <p>Measurements should be both accurate and precise. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the true value. For example, 66 mL is a fairly accurate measure- ment of the liquid in Figure 2.6. Precision is how exact a measurement is. A measurement of 65.5 mL is more precise than a measurement of 66 mL. But in Figure 2.6, it is not as accurate. You can think of accuracy and precision in terms of a game like darts. If you are aiming for the bulls-eye and get all of the darts close to it, you are being both accurate and precise. If you get the darts all close to each other somewhere else on the board, you are precise, but not accurate. And finally, if you get the darts spread out all over the board, you are neither accurate nor precise. </p>

        <h3>Keeping Records</h3>
        <p>Record keeping is very important in scientific investigations. Follow the tips below to keep good science records. Use a bound laboratory notebook so pages will not be lost. Write in ink for a permanent record. Record the steps of all procedures. Record all measurements and observations. Use drawings as needed. Date all entries, including drawings. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Calculating</h3>
        <p>Doing science often requires calculations. Converting units is just one example. Calculations are also needed to find derived quantities. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Calculating Derived Quantities</h3>
        <p>Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more different measurements. Examples include area and volume. Its easy to calculate these quantities for a simple shape. For a rectangular solid, like the one in Figure 2.7, the formulas are: Area (of each side) = length  width (l  w) Volume = length  width  height (l  w  h) Helpful Hints When calculating area and volume, make sure that: all the measurements have the same units. answers have the correct units. Area should be in squared units, such as cm2 ; volume should be in cubed units, such as cm3 . Can you explain why? Naturally, not all derived quantities will have the same types of units. In the examples above, the only fundamental unit used was meters for the length of one of the sides of the box. However, if you had a quantity like speed (a derived quantity), it would be equal to distance traveled (which is meters) divided by the amount of time you spent traveling that distance (which is in seconds). Therefore your speed would be measured in meters per second. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Significant Figures</h3>
        <p>Assume you are finding the area of a rectangle with a length of 6.8 m and a width of 6.9 m. When you multiply the length by the width on your calculator, the answer you get is 46.92 m2 . Is this the correct answer? No; the correct answer is 46.9 m2 . The correct answer must be rounded down so there is just one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thats because the answer cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than any of the original measurements. Using extra digits implies a greater degree of precision than actually exists. The correct number of digits is called the number of significant figures. To learn more about significant figures and rounding, you can watch the videos at the URLs below.  (3:20)  (8:30) </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Scientific Notation</h3>
        <p>Quantities in science may be very large or very small. This usually requires many zeroes to the left or right of the decimal point. Such numbers can be hard to read and write accurately. Thats where scientific notation comes in. Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in this format: a  10b The letter a stands for a decimal number. The letter b stands for an exponent, or power, of 10. For example, the number 300 is written as 3.0  102 . The number 0.03 is written as 3.0  10 2 . Figure 2.8 explains how to convert numbers to and from scientific notation. For a review of exponents, watch:  You Try It! Problem: Write the number 46,000,000 in scientific notation. </p>

        <h3>Organizing Data</h3>
        <p>In a scientific investigation, a researcher may make and record many measurements. These may be compiled in spreadsheets or data tables. In this form, it may be hard to see patterns or trends in the data. Descriptive statistics and graphs can help organize the data so patterns and trends are easier to spot. Example: A vehicle checkpoint was set up on a busy street. The number of vehicles of each type that passed by the checkpoint in one hour was counted and recorded in Table 2.4. These are the only types of vehicles that passed the checkpoint during this period. Type of Vehicle 4-door cars 2-door cars SUVs Number 150 50 80 Type of Vehicle vans pick-up trucks Number 50 70 </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>A descriptive statistic sums up a set of data in a single number. Examples include the mean and range. The mean is the average value. It gives you an idea of the typical measurement. The mean is calculated by summing the individual measurements and dividing the total by the number of measurements. For the data in Table 2.4, the mean number of vehicles by type is: (150 + 50 + 80 + 50 + 70)  5 = 80. (There are two other words people can sometimes use when they use the word "average." They might be referring to a quantity called the "median" or the "mode." Youll see these quantities in later courses, but for now, well just say the average is the same thing as the mean.) The range is the total spread of values. It gives you an idea of the variation in the measurements. The range is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. For the data in Table 2.4, the range in numbers of vehicles by type is: 150 - 50 = 100. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Graphs</h3>
        <p>Graphs can help you visualize a set of data. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs. Figure 2.9 shows an example of each type of graph. The bar and circle graphs are based on the data in Table 2.4, while the line graph is based on unrelated data. You can see more examples at this URL:  Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different types of things. The bar graph in Figure Circle graphs are especially useful for showing percents of a whole. The circle graph in Figure 2.9 shows the percent of all vehicles counted that were of each type. Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time. The line graph in Figure 2.9 shows how distance from school changed over time when some students went on a class trip. Helpful Hints Circle graphs show percents of a whole. What are percents? Percents are fractions in which the denominator is 100. Example: 30% = 30/100 Percents can also be expressed as decimal numbers. Example: 30% = 0.30 You Try It! Problem: Show how to calculate the percents in the circle graph in Figure 2.9.

        <h3>Using Models</h3>
        <p>Did you ever read a road map, sketch an object, or play with toy trucks or dolls? No doubt, the answer is yes. What do all these activities have in common? They all involve models. A model is a representation of an object, system, or process. For example, a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on the ground. Models are very useful in science. They provide a way to investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to investigate directly. Figure 2.10 shows an example of a model in chemistry. To be useful, a model must closely represent the real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to manipulate than the real thing. Do you think the model in Figure 2.10 meets these criteria? </p>

        <h3>Staying Safe in Science</h3>
        <p>Research in physical science can be exciting, but it also has potential dangers. Whether in the lab or in the field, knowing how to stay safe is important. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Safety Symbols</h3>
        <p>Lab procedures and equipment may be labeled with safety symbols. These symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers. A list of common safety symbols is shown in Figure 2.11. Do you know how to avoid each hazard? You can learn more at this URL: </p>

        <h3>Safety Rules</h3>
        <p>Following basic safety rules is the best way to stay safe in science. Safe practices help prevent accidents. Several lab safety rules are listed below. Different rules may apply when you work in the field. But in all cases, you should always follow your teachers instructions. Lab Safety Rules Wear safety gear, including goggles, an apron, and gloves. Wear a long-sleeved shirt and shoes that completely cover your feet. Tie back your hair if it is long. Do not eat or drink in the lab. Never work alone. Never perform unauthorized experiments. Never point the open end of a test tube at yourself or another person. Always add acid to water never water to acid and add the acid slowly. To smell a substance, use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smell it directly. This is demonstrated in Figure 2.12. When disposing of liquids in the sink, flush them down the drain with lots of water. Wash glassware and counters when you finish your lab work. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab. Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs. Report all accidents, even if you dont think they are serious. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Most scientists use the SI system of units. It includes the Kelvin scale for temperature. Measurements should be both accurate and precise. Good record keeping is very important in scientific research. Doing science often requires calculations, such as finding derived quantities. Calculations may involve significant figures or scientific notation. Descriptive statistics and graphs help organize data so patterns and trends are more apparent. Descriptive statistics include the mean and range. Types of graphs include bar, circle, and line graphs. A model is a representation of an object, system, or process. Models help scientists investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to study directly. Staying safe while doing scientific research means recognizing safety symbols and following safety rules. </p>
