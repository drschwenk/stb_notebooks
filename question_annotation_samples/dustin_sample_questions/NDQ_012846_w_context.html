        <h3>Introduction to Radioactivity</h3>
        <p>Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit, or give off, charged particles and energy from the nucleus. The charged particles and energy are called by the general term radiation. Only unstable nuclei emit radiation. When they do, they gain or lose protons. Then the atoms become different elements. (Be careful not to confuse this radiation with electromagnetic radiation, which has to do with the light given off by atoms as they absorb and then emit energy.) </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Discovery of Radioactivity</h3>
        <p>Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by a French physicist named Antoine Henri Becquerel. Becquerel was experimenting with uranium, which glows after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel wanted to see if the glow was caused by rays of energy, like rays of light and X-rays. He placed a bit of uranium on a photographic plate. The plate was similar to film thats used today to take X-rays. You can see an example of an X-ray in Figure 11.1. As Becquerel predicted, the uranium left an image on the photographic plate. This meant that uranium gives off rays after being exposed to sunlight. Becquerel was a good scientist, so he wanted to repeat his experiment to confirm his results. He placed more uranium on another photographic plate. However, the day had turned cloudy, so he tucked the plate and uranium in a drawer to try again another day. He wasnt expecting the uranium to leave an image on the plate without being exposed to sunlight. To his surprise, there was an image on the plate in the drawer the next day. Becquerel had discovered that uranium gives off rays without getting energy from light. He had discovered radioactivity, for which he received a Nobel prize. To learn more about the importance of Becquerels research, go to this URL: http://nobelprize.org/no Another scientist, who worked with Becquerel, actually came up with the term "radioactivity." The other scientist was the French chemist Marie Curie. She went on to discover the radioactive elements polonium and radium. She won two Nobel Prizes for her discoveries. You can learn more about Marie Curie at this URL: http://nobelprize.or </p>

        <h3>Radioisotopes</h3>
        <p>Isotopes are atoms of the same element that differ from each other because they have different numbers of neutrons. Many elements have one or more isotopes that are radioactive. Radioactive isotopes are called radioisotopes. An example of a radioisotope is carbon-14. All carbon atoms have 6 protons, and most have 6 neutrons. These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the mass number (6 protons + 6 neutrons). A tiny percentage of carbon atoms have 8 neutrons instead of the usual 6. These atoms are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 are unstable because they have too many neutrons. To be stable, a small nucleus like carbon, with just 6 protons, must have a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons. In other words, it must have the same number of neutrons as protons. In a large nucleus, with many protons, the ratio must be 2:1 or even 3:1 protons to neutrons. In elements with more than 83 protons, all the isotopes are radioactive (see Figure 11.2). The force of repulsion among all those protons overcomes the strong force holding them together. This makes the nuclei unstable and radioactive. Elements with more than 92 protons have such unstable nuclei that these elements do not even exist in nature. They exist only if they are created in a lab. </p>

        <h3>Radiation in the World Around Us</h3>
        <p>A low level of radiation occurs naturally in the environment. This is called background radiation. It comes from various sources. One source is rocks, which may contain small amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. Another source is cosmic rays. These are charged particles that arrive on Earth from outer space. Background radiation is generally considered to be safe for living things. A source of radiation that may be more dangerous is radon. Radon is a radioactive gas that forms in rocks underground. It can seep into basements and get trapped inside buildings. Then it may build up and become harmful to people who breathe it. Other sources of radiation are described in the interactive animation at this URL: http://w </p>

        <h3>Dangers of Radiation</h3>
        <p>You may have seen a sign like the one in Figure 11.3. It warns people that there is radiation in the area. Exposure to radiation can be very dangerous. Radiation damages living things by knocking electrons out of atoms and changing them to ions. Radiation also breaks bonds in DNA and other biochemical compounds. A single large exposure to radiation can burn the skin and cause radiation sickness. Symptoms of this illness include extreme fatigue, destruction of blood cells, and loss of hair. Long-term exposure to lower levels of radiation can cause cancer. For example, radon in buildings can cause lung cancer. Marie Curie died of cancer, most likely because of exposure to radiation in her research. To learn more about the harmful health effects of radiation, go to this URL:  . Nonliving things can also be damaged by radiation. For example, high levels of radiation can remove electrons from metals. This may weaken metals in nuclear power plants and space vehicles, both of which are exposed to very high levels of radiation. </p>

        <h3>Detecting Radiation</h3>
        <p>One reason radiation is dangerous is that it cant be detected with the senses. You normally cant see it, smell it, hear it, or feel it. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one in Figure 11.4, has a tube that contains atoms of a gas. If radiation enters the tube, it turns gas atoms to ions that carry electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. </p>

        <h3>Using Radiation</h3>
        <p>Despite its dangers, radioactivity has several uses. It can be used to determine the ages of ancient rocks and fossils. This use of radioactivity is explained in this chapters "Radioactive Decay" lesson. Radioactivity can also be used as a source of power to generate electricity. This use of radioactivity is covered later on in this chapter in the lesson "Nuclear Energy." Radioactivity can even be used to diagnose and treat diseases, including cancer. Cancer cells grow rapidly and take up a lot of glucose for energy. Glucose containing radioactive elements can be given to patients. Cancer cells will take up more of the glucose than normal cells do and give off radiation. The radiation can be detected with special machines (see Figure 11.5). Radioactive elements taken up by cancer cells may also be used to kill the cells and treat the disease. You can learn more about medical uses of radiation at the URL below.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Radioactivity is the ability of an atom to emit radiation in the form of charged particles and energy from the nucleus. Many elements have one or more radioactive isotopes. Elements with more than 83 protons have only radioactive isotopes. Harmless background radiation comes from radioactive elements in rocks and from cosmic rays. Other sources of radiation, such as radon, are harmful. They may cause illness in living things and damage materials such as metals. Radiation has several uses, including detecting and treating cancer. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Some elements naturally change into different elements. To understand how this happens, first recall what an element is. An element is a unique substance, with a unique number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. No two elements have the same number of protons. For example, carbon atoms always have six protons. If an atom has a different number of protons, it isnt carbon. For an element to change into a different element, then, it must change the number of protons in the nucleus of its atoms. This happens only in radioactive elements. </p>
