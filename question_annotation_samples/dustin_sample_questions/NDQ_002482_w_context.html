        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
        <p>Jupiter, shown in Figure 25.19, is the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter is named for the king of the gods in Roman mythology. Jupiter is truly a giant! The planet has 318 times the mass of Earth, and over 1,300 times Earths volume. So Jupiter is much less dense than Earth. Because Jupiter is so large, it reflects a lot of sunlight. When it is visible, it is the brightest object in the night sky besides the Moon and Venus. Jupiter is quite far from the Earth. The planet is more than five times as far from Earth as the Sun. It takes Jupiter about 12 Earth years to orbit once around the Sun. </p>

        <h3>A Ball of Gas and Liquid</h3>
        <p>Since Jupiter is a gas giant, could a spacecraft land on its surface? The answer is no. There is no solid surface at all! Jupiter is made mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of other elements. The outer layers of the planet are gas. Deeper within the planet, the intense pressure condenses the gases into a liquid. Jupiter may have a small rocky core at its center. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>A Stormy Atmosphere</h3>
        <p>Jupiters atmosphere is unlike any other in the solar system! The upper layer contains clouds of ammonia. The ammonia is different colored bands. These bands rotate around the planet. The ammonia also swirls around in tremendous storms. The Great Red Spot, shown in Figure 25.20, is Jupiters most noticeable feature. The spot is an enormous, oval-shaped storm. It is more than three times as wide as the entire Earth! Clouds in the storm rotate counterclockwise. They make one complete turn every six days or so. The Great Red Spot has been on Jupiter for at least 300 years. It may have been observed as early as 1664. It is possible that this storm is a permanent feature on Jupiter. No one knows for sure. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Jupiters Moons and Rings</h3>
        <p>Jupiter has lots of moons. As of 2011, we have discovered over 60 natural satellites of Jupiter. Four are big enough and bright enough to be seen from Earth using a pair of binoculars. These four moons were first discovered by Galileo in 1610. They are called the Galilean moons. Figure 25.21 shows the four Galilean moons and their sizes relative to Jupiters Great Red Spot. These moons are named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The Galilean moons are larger than even the biggest dwarf planets, Pluto and Eris. Ganymede is the biggest moon in the solar system. It is even larger than the planet Mercury! Scientists think that Europa is a good place to look for extraterrestrial life. Europa is the smallest of the Galilean moons. The moons surface is a smooth layer of ice. Scientists think that the ice may sit on top of an ocean of liquid water. How could Europa have liquid water when it is so far from the Sun? Europa is heated by Jupiter. Jupiters tidal forces are so great that they stretch and squash its moon. This could produce enough heat for there to be liquid water. Numerous missions have been planned to explore Europa, including plans to drill through the ice and send a probe into the ocean. However, no such mission has yet been attempted. In 1979, two spacecrafts, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, visited Jupiter and its moons. Photos from the Voyager missions </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Saturn</h3>
        <p>Saturn, shown in Figure 25.22, is famous for its beautiful rings. Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system. Saturns mass is about 95 times Earths mass. The gas giant is 755 times Earths volume. Despite its large size, Saturn is the least dense planet in our solar system. Saturn is actually less dense than water. This means that if there were a bathtub big enough, Saturn would float! In Roman mythology, Saturn was the father of Jupiter. Saturn orbits the Sun once about every 30 Earth years. Saturns composition is similar to Jupiters. The planet is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. These elements are gases in the outer layers and liquids in the deeper layers. Saturn may also have a small solid core. Saturns upper atmosphere has clouds in bands of different colors. These clouds rotate rapidly around the planet. But Saturn has fewer storms than Jupiter. Thunder and lightning have been seen in the storms on Saturn (Figure 25.23). </p>

        <h3>A Weird Hexagon</h3>
        <p>There is a strange feature at Saturns north pole. The clouds form a hexagonal pattern, as shown in the infrared image in Figure 25.24. This hexagon was viewed by Voyager 1 in the 1980s. It was still there when the Cassini Orbiter visited in 2006. No one is sure why the clouds form this pattern. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Saturns Rings</h3>
        <p>Saturns rings were first observed by Galileo in 1610. He didnt know they were rings and thought that they were two large moons. One moon was on either side of the planet. In 1659, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens realized that they were rings circling Saturns equator. The rings appear tilted. This is because Saturn is tilted about 27 degrees to its side. The Voyager 1 spacecraft visited Saturn in 1980. Voyager 2 followed in 1981. These probes sent back detailed pictures of Saturn, its rings, and some of its moons. From the Voyager data, we learned that Saturns rings are made of particles of water and ice with a little bit of dust. There are several gaps in the rings. These gaps were cleared out by moons within the rings. Ring dust and gas are attracted to the moon by its gravity. This leaves a gap in the rings. Other gaps in the rings are caused by the competing forces of Saturn and its moons outside the rings. </p>

        <h3>Saturns Moons</h3>
        <p>As of 2011, over 60 moons have been identified around Saturn. Only seven of Saturns moons are round. All but one is smaller than Earths Moon. Some of the very small moons are found within the rings. All the particles in the rings are like little moons, because they orbit around Saturn. Someone must decide which ones are large enough to call moons. Saturns largest moon, Titan, is about one and a half times the size of Earths Moon. Titan is even larger than the planet Mercury. Figure 25.25 compares the size of Titan to Earth. Scientists are very interested in Titan. The moon has an atmosphere that is thought to be like Earths first atmosphere. This atmosphere was around before life developed on Earth. Like Jupiters moon, Europa, Titan may have a layer of liquid water under a layer of ice. Scientists now think that there are lakes on Titans surface. Dont take a dip, though. These lakes contain liquid methane and ethane instead of water! Methane and ethane are compounds found in natural gas. </p>

        <h3>Uranus</h3>
        <p>Uranus, shown in Figure 25.26, is named for the Greek god of the sky, the father of Saturn. Astronomers pronounce the name YOOR-uh-nuhs. Uranus was not known to ancient observers. The planet was first discovered with a telescope by the astronomer William Herschel in 1781. Uranus is faint because it is very far away. Its distance from the Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers (1.8 billion miles). A photon from the Sun takes about 2 hours and 40 minutes to reach Uranus. Uranus orbits the Sun once about every 84 Earth years. </p>

        <h3>An Icy BlueGreen Ball</h3>
        <p>Uranus is a lot like Jupiter and Saturn. The planet is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. There is a thick layer of gas on the outside. Further on the inside is liquid. But Uranus has a higher percentage of icy materials than Jupiter and Saturn. These materials include water, ammonia, and methane. Uranus is also different because of its blue-green color. Clouds of methane filter out red light. This leaves a blue-green color. The atmosphere of Uranus has bands of clouds. These clouds are hard to see in normal light. The result is that the planet looks like a plain blue ball. Uranus is the least massive outer planet. Its mass is only about 14 times the mass of Earth. Like all of the outer planets, Uranus is much less dense than Earth. Gravity is actually weaker than on Earths surface. If you were at the top of the clouds on Uranus, you would weigh about 10 percent less than what you weigh on Earth. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Sideways Planet</h3>
        <p>All of the planets rotate on their axes in the same direction that they move around the Sun. Except for Uranus. Uranus is tilted on its side. Its axis is almost parallel to its orbit. So Uranus rolls along like a bowling ball as it revolves around the Sun. How did Uranus get this way? Scientists think that the planet was struck and knocked over by another planet-sized object. This collision probably took place billions of years ago. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Rings and Moons of Uranus</h3>
        <p>Uranus has a faint system of rings, as shown in Figure 25.27. The rings circle the planets equator. However, Uranus is tilted on its side. So the rings are almost perpendicular to the planets orbit. We have discovered 27 moons around Uranus. All but a few are named for characters from the plays of William Shakespeare. The five biggest moons of Uranus, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon, are shown in Figure </p>

        <h3>Neptune</h3>
        <p>Neptune is shown in Figure 25.29. It is the eighth planet from the Sun. Neptune is so far away you need a telescope to see it from Earth. Neptune is the most distant planet in our solar system. It is nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun. One orbit around the Sun takes Neptune 165 Earth years. Scientists guessed Neptunes existence before it was discovered. Uranus did not always appear exactly where it should. They said this was because a planet beyond Uranus was pulling on it. This gravitational pull was affecting its orbit. Neptune was discovered in 1846. It was just where scientists predicted it would be! Due to its blue color, the planet was named Neptune for the Roman god of the sea. Uranus and Neptune are often considered sister planets. They are very similar to each other. Neptune has slightly more mass than Uranus, but it is slightly smaller in size. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Extremes of Cold and Wind</h3>
        <p>Like Uranus, Neptune is blue. The blue color is caused by gases in its atmosphere, including methane. Neptune is not a smooth looking ball like Uranus. The planet has a few darker and lighter spots. When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1986, there was a large dark-blue spot south of the equator. This spot was called the Great Dark Spot. When the Hubble Space Telescope photographed Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Another dark spot had appeared north of the equator. Astronomers believe that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune. Neptunes appearance changes due to its turbulent atmosphere. Winds are stronger than on any other planet in the solar system. Wind speeds can reach 1,100 km/h (700 mph). This is close to the speed of sound! The rapid winds surprised astronomers. This is because Neptune receives little energy from the Sun to power weather systems. It is not surprising that Neptune is one of the coldest places in the solar system. Temperatures at the top of the clouds are about 218C (360F). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Neptunes Rings and Moons</h3>
        <p>Like the other outer planets, Neptune has rings of ice and dust. These rings are much thinner and fainter than Saturns. Neptunes rings may be unstable. They may change or disappear in a relatively short time. Neptune has 13 known moons. Only Triton, shown in Figure 25.30, has enough mass to be round. Triton orbits in the direction opposite to Neptunes orbit. Scientists think Triton did not form around Neptune. The satellite was captured by Neptunes gravity as it passed by. </p>

        <h3>Pluto</h3>
        <p>Pluto was once considered one of the outer planets, but when the definition of a planet was changed in 2006, Pluto became one of the dwarf planets. It is one of the largest and brightest objects that make up this group. Look for Pluto in the next lesson, in the discussion of dwarf planets. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>3. How are the outer planets different from the inner planets? 4. Describe Saturns rings? What are they and what has made them that way? 5. How can liquid be found so far out in the solar system where temperatures are so cold? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Describe main features of the outer planets and their moons.
Compare the outer planets to each other and to Earth.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The four outer planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are all gas giants made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Their thick outer layers are gases and have liquid interiors. All of the outer planets have lots of moons, as well as planetary rings made of dust and other particles. Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. It has bands of different colored clouds, and a long-lasting storm called the Great Red Spot. Jupiter has over 60 moons. The four biggest were discovered by Galileo, and are called the Galilean moons. One of the Galilean moons, Europa, may have an ocean of liquid water under a layer of ice. The conditions in this ocean might be right for life to have developed. Saturn is smaller than Jupiter, but very similar to Jupiter. Saturn has a large system of beautiful rings. Saturns largest moon, Titan, has an atmosphere similar to Earths atmosphere before life formed. Uranus and Neptune were discovered using a telescope. They are similar to each other in size and composition. They are both smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, and also have more icy materials. Uranus is tilted on its side, probably due to a collision with a large object in the distant past. Neptune is very cold and has very strong winds. It had a large dark spot that disappeared. Another dark spot appeared on another part of the planet. These dark spots are storms in Neptunes atmosphere. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>6. Why did Jupiters Great Red Spot last for 300 years and Neptunes Great Dark Spot disappear in a couple of decades? 7. If you were given the task of finding life in the solar system somewhere besides Earth where would you look? 8. The atmosphere of Saturns moon Titan because it resembles the early Earths atmosphere. Why is this interesting to scientists? </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>The inner planets are small and rocky, while the outer planets are large and made of gases. Why might the planets have formed into these two groups? We have discussed the Sun, the planets, and the moons of the planets. What other objects can you think of that can be found in our solar system? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are the outer planets of our solar system. These are the four planets farthest from the Sun. The outer planets are much larger than the inner planets. Since they are mostly made of gases, they are also called gas giants. The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium. These are the same elements that make up most of the Sun. Astronomers think that most of the nebula was hydrogen and helium. The inner planets lost these very light gases. Their gravity was too low to keep them and they floated away into space. The Sun and the outer planets had enough gravity to keep the hydrogen and helium. All of the outer planets have numerous moons. They also have planetary rings made of dust and other small particles. Only the rings of Saturn can be easily seen from Earth. </p>
