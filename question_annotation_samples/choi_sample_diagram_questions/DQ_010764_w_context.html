        <h3>Energy from Nuclear Fission</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy from a very small amount of matter. For example, nuclear fission of a tiny pellet of uranium-235, like the one pictured in Figure 11.11, can release as much energy as burning 1,000 kilograms of coal! Nuclear fission of uranium-235 can be represented by this equation: 235 92 U + 1 141 Neutron !92 36 Kr + 56 Ba + 3 Neutrons + Energy As shown in Figure 11.12, the reaction begins when a nucleus of uranium-235 absorbs a neutron. This can happen naturally or when a neutron is deliberately crashed into a uranium nucleus in a nuclear power plant. In either case, the nucleus of uranium becomes very unstable and splits in two. In this example, it forms krypton-92 and barium-141. The reaction also releases three neutrons and a great deal of energy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nuclear Chain Reaction</h3>
        <p>The neutrons released in this nuclear fission reaction may be captured by other uranium nuclei and cause them to fission as well. This can start a nuclear chain reaction (see Figure 11.13). In a chain reaction, one fission reaction leads to others, which lead to others, and so on. A nuclear chain reaction is similar to a pile of wood burning. If you start one piece of wood burning, enough heat is produced by the burning wood to start the rest of the pile burning without any further help from you. You can see another example of a chain reaction at this URL: </p>

        <h3>Using Energy from Nuclear Fission</h3>
        <p>If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy all at once. This is what happens in an atomic bomb. If a nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy more slowly. This is what occurs in a nuclear power plant. The reaction may be controlled by inserting rods of material that do not undergo fission into the core of fissioning material (see Figure 11.14). The radiation from the controlled fission is used to heat water and turn it to steam. The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning turbine runs a generator, which produces electricity. </p>

        <h3>Pros and Cons of Nuclear Fission</h3>
        <p>In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. The main concern over the use of nuclear fission is the risk of radiation. Accidents at nuclear power plants can release harmful radiation that endangers people and other living things. Even without accidents, the used fuel that is left after nuclear fission reactions is still radioactive and very dangerous. It takes thousands of years for it to decay until it no longer releases harmful radiation. Therefore, used fuel must be stored securely to people and other living things. You can learn more about the problem of radioactive waste at this URL: </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Energy from Nuclear Fusion</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fusion is the opposite of nuclear fission. In fusion, two or more small nuclei combine to form a single, larger nucleus. An example is shown in Figure 11.15. In this example, two hydrogen nuclei fuse to form a helium nucleus. A neutron and a great deal of energy are also released. In fact, fusion releases even more energy than fission does. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>The Power of Stars</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium occurs naturally in the sun and other stars. It takes place only at extremely high temperatures. Thats because a great deal of energy is needed to overcome the force of repulsion between positively charged nuclei. The suns energy comes from fusion in its core, where temperatures reach millions of Kelvin (see Figure 11.16). </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Using Nuclear Fusion</h3>
        <p>Scientists are searching for ways to create controlled nuclear fusion reactions on Earth. Their goal is develop nuclear fusion power plants, where the energy from fusion of hydrogen nuclei can be converted to electricity. How this might work is shown in Figure 11.17. The use of nuclear fusion for energy has several pros. Unlike nuclear fission, which involves dangerous radioiso- topes, nuclear fusion involves hydrogen and helium. These elements are harmless. Hydrogen is also very plentiful. There is a huge amount of hydrogen in ocean water. The hydrogen in just a gallon of water could produce as much energy by nuclear fusion as burning 1,140 liters (300 gallons) of gasoline! The hydrogen in the oceans would generate enough energy to supply all the worlds people for a very long time. Unfortunately, using energy from nuclear fusion is far from a reality. Scientists are a long way from developing the necessary technology. One problem is raising temperatures high enough for fusion to take place. Another problem is that matter this hot exists only in the plasma state. There are no known materials that can contain plasma, although a magnet might be able to do it. Thats because plasma consists of ions and responds to magnetism. You can learn more about research on nuclear fusion at the URL below. </p>

        <h3>Nuclear Energy and Einsteins Famous Equation</h3>
        <p>Probably the most famous equation in the world is E = mc2 . You may have heard of it. You may have even seen it on a tee shirt or coffee mug. Its a simple equation that was derived in 1905 by the physicist Albert Einstein (see Figure 11.18). Although the equation is simple, it is incredibly important. It changed how scientists view two of the most basic concepts in science: matter and energy. The equation shows that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing. It also shows how matter and energy are related. In addition, Einsteins equation explains why nuclear fission and nuclear fusion produce so much energy. You can listen to a recording of Einstein explaining his famous equation at this URL: </p>

        <h3>What Einsteins Equation Means</h3>
        <p>In Einsteins equation, the variable E stands for energy and the variable m stands for mass. The c in the equation is a constant. It stands for the speed of light. The speed of light is 300,000 kilometers (186,000 miles) per second, so c2 is a very big number, no matter what units are used to measure it. Einsteins equation means that the energy in a given amount of matter is equal to its mass times the square of the speed of light. Thats a huge amount of energy from even a tiny amount of mass. Suppose, for example, that you have 1 gram of matter. Thats about the mass of a paperclip. Multiplying that mass by the square of the speed of light yields enough energy to power 3,600 homes for a year! </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mass and Energy in Nuclear Reactions</h3>
        <p>When the nucleus of a radioisotope undergoes fission or fusion, it loses a tiny amount of mass. What happens to the lost mass? It isnt really lost at all. It is converted to energy. How much energy? E = mc2 . The change in mass is tiny, but it results in a great deal of energy. What about the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy? Do they not apply to nuclear reactions? We dont need to throw out these laws. Instead, we just need to combine them. It is more correct to say that the sum of mass and energy is always conserved in a nuclear reaction. Mass may change to energy, but the amount of mass and energy combined remains the same. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This releases a great deal of energy. Nuclear power plants use the energy from nuclear fission to generate electricity. Nuclear fusion is the fusing of two or more smaller nuclei to form a single, larger nucleus. Fusion releases even more energy than fission. Researchers are trying to find a way to use the energy from nuclear fusion to generate electricity. Einsteins equation, E = mc2 , shows that matter and energy are two forms of the same thing. In nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, a tiny amount of matter changes to a huge amount of energy. The amount of energy equals the mass of the "lost" matter times the square of the speed of light. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>6. Relate Einsteins equation, E = mc2 , to the energy released in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. 7. Less than one-quarter of the electricity used in the U.S. is generated from nuclear energy. Some people think we should use more nuclear power. Other people think we should use less or even none at all. Take a stand on this issue, and present facts and logical arguments to support your point of view. </p>

        <p>This Diagram shows how a Nuclear plant Work. Heat is used to boil water into steam and drive a turbine which turns a generator, making electricity. There are two separate water systems involved. One pumps fluid around the core of the reactor, absorbing the heat and keeping the pile from going into a meltdown. This liquid is kept separate because it's highly radioactive. It's pumped through carefully sealed pipes that go through a second water tank. The heat from the irradiated water heats these pipes, and then the pipes heat the second water tank, turning that water into steam. The steam is used to spin turbines, which are kind of like an RC car's motor except kind of opposite like, this generate electricity. The turbine water is clean and relatively safe, because it's not in direct contact with the irradiated systems.</p>

        <p>This is how we get electricity from nuclear power. The water near the cooling towers is through the reservoir and then back up to a filter. The water then goes through the reactor core and turns into steam. The steam from the reactor then travels into the condenser and turbines were it then goes through the generator and produces electricity.</p>

        <p>Nuclear energy is the energy released in nuclear reactions. Two types of reactions that release huge amounts of energy are nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. The diagram demonstrates Nuclear Fusion. Nuclear fusion is a nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons and/or protons). In the diagram, there are two hydrogen isotopes, Deuterium and Tritium. These combine to form a single, larger nucleus. They form a helium nucleus and a neutron. A great deal of energy is also released.</p>

        <p>The diagram illustrates the process of Nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is the splitting of the nucleus of an atom into two smaller nuclei. This type of reaction releases a great deal of energy like heat and radiation from a very small amount of matter. Illustrated in the diagram is a neutron colliding with a uranium nucleus causing it to split into two smaller daughter nuclei. This process releases a large amount of energy and also releases three more fast neutrons. This type of reaction is used to create a chain reaction. If a nuclear chain reaction is uncontrolled, it produces a lot of energy all at once. This is what happens in an atomic bomb. If a nuclear chain reaction is controlled, it produces energy more slowly. This is what occurs in a nuclear power plant. The radiation from the controlled fission is used to heat water and turn it to steam. The steam is under pressure and causes a turbine to spin. The spinning turbine runs a generator, which produces electricity.</p>
