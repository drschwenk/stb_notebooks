        <h3>Geologic Time</h3>
        <p>Its hard to grasp the vast amounts of time since Earth formed and life first appeared. It may help to think of Earths history as a 24-hour day. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Earth in a Day</h3>
        <p>Figure 7.17 shows the history of Earth in a day. In this model, the planet forms at midnight. The first prokaryotes evolve around 3:00 am. Eukaryotes evolve at about 1:00 pm. Animals dont evolve until almost 8:00 pm. Humans appear only in the last minute of the day. Relating these major events in Earths history to a 24-hour day helps to put them in perspective. </p>

        <h3>Geologic Time Scale</h3>
        <p>Another tool for understanding the history of Earth and its life is the geologic time scale. You can see this time scale in Figure 7.18. It divides Earths history into eons, eras, and periods. These divisions are based on major changes in geology, climate, and the evolution of life. The geologic time scale organizes Earths history on the basis of important events instead of time alone. It also puts more focus on recent events, about which we know the most. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Precambrian Lifes Origins</h3>
        <p>The Precambrian Supereon is the first major division of Earths history (see Figure 7.18). It covers the time from Earths formation 4.6 billion years ago to 544 million years ago. To see how life evolved during the Precambrian and beyond, watch this wonderful video. Its a good introduction to the rest of the lesson. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

        <h3>Ancient Earth</h3>
        <p>When Earth first formed, it was a fiery hot, barren ball. It had no oceans or atmosphere. Rivers of melted rock flowed over its surface. Gradually, the planet cooled and formed a solid crust. Gases from volcanoes formed an atmosphere, although it contained only a trace of oxygen. As the planet continued to cool, clouds formed and rain fell. Rainwater helped form oceans. The ancient atmosphere and oceans would be toxic to modern life, but they set the stage for life to begin. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>First Organic Molecules and Cells</h3>
        <p>All living things consist of organic molecules. Many scientists think that organic molecules evolved before cells, perhaps as early as 4 billion years ago. Its possible that lightning sparked chemical reactions in Earths early atmosphere. This could have created a soup of organic molecules from inorganic chemicals. Some scientists think that RNA was the first organic molecule to evolve. RNA can not only encode genetic instructions. Some RNA molecules can carry out chemical reactions. All living things are made of one or more cells. How the first cells evolved is not known for certain. Scientists speculate that lipid membranes grew around RNA molecules. The earliest cells may have consisted of little more than RNA inside a lipid membrane. You can see a model of such a cell in Figure 7.19. The first cells probably evolved between 3.8 and 4 billion years ago. Scientists think that one cell, called the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), gave rise to all of the following life on Earth. LUCA may have existed around 3.5 billion years ago. </p>

        <h3>New Adaptations</h3>
        <p>The earliest cells were heterotrophs. They were unable to make food. Instead, they got energy by "eating" organic molecules in the soup around them. The earliest cells were also prokaryotes. They lacked a nucleus and other organelles. Gradually, these and other traits evolved. Photosynthesis evolved about 3 billion years ago. After that, certain cells could use sunlight to make food. These were the first autotrophs. They made food for themselves and other cells. They also added oxygen to the atmosphere. The oxygen was a waste product of photosynthesis. Oxygen was toxic to many cells. They had evolved in its absence. Many of them died out. The few that survived evolved a new way to use oxygen. They used it to get energy from food. This is the process of cellular respiration. The first eukaryotic cells probably evolved about 2 billion years ago. Thats when cells evolved organelles and a nucleus. Figure 7.20 shows one theory about the origin of organelles. According to this theory, a large cell engulfed small cells. The small cells took on special roles that helped the large cell function. In return, the small cells got nutrients from the large cell. Eventually, the large and small cells could no longer live apart. With their specialized organelles, eukaryotic cells were powerful and efficient. Eukaryotes would go on to evolve sexual reproduction. They would also evolve into multicellular organisms. The first multicellular organisms evolved about 1 billion years ago. </p>

        <h3>Precambrian Mass Extinction</h3>
        <p>At the end of the Precambrian, a mass extinction occurred. In a mass extinction, the majority of species die out. The Precambrian mass extinction was the first of six mass extinctions that occurred on Earth. Its not certain what caused this first mass extinction. Changes in Earths geology and climate were no doubt involved. </p>

        <h3>Paleozoic Era</h3>
        <p>The Paleozoic Era lasted from 544 to 245 million years ago. It is divided into six periods. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cambrian Period</h3>
        <p>The Precambrian mass extinction opened up many niches for new organisms to fill. As a result, the Cambrian Period began with an explosion of new kinds of living things. For example, many types of simple animals called sponges evolved. Trilobites were also very common. Sponges and trilobites were small ocean invertebrates. These are animals without a backbone. You can see examples of them in Figure 7.21. </p>

        <h3>Ordovician Period</h3>
        <p>During the Ordovician Period, the oceans became filled with many kinds of invertebrates. The first fish also evolved. Plants colonized the land for the first time. However, animals remained in the water. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Silurian Period</h3>
        <p>Corals appeared in the oceans during the Silurian period. Fish continued to evolve. On land, vascular plants appeared. These are plants that have special tissues to circulate water and other substances. This allowed plants to become larger and colonize drier habitats. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Devonian Period</h3>
        <p>During the Devonian Period, the first seed plants evolved. Seeds have a protective coat and contain stored food. This was a big advantage over other types of plant reproduction. Seed plants eventually became the most common type of plants on land. In the oceans, fish with lobe fins evolved. These fish could breathe air when they raised their head above water. This was a step in the evolution of animals that could live on land. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carboniferous Period</h3>
        <p>In the Carboniferous Period, forests of huge ferns and trees were widespread. You can see how these first forests might have looked in Figure 7.22. After the ferns and trees died, their remains eventually turned to coal. The first amphibians also evolved during this period. They could live on land but had to return to the water to lay their eggs. After amphibians, the earliest reptiles appeared. They were the first animals that could reproduce on land and move away from the water. </p>

        <h3>Permian Period</h3>
        <p>During the Permian Period, all the major landmasses moved together to form one supercontinent. The supercontinent has been named Pangaea. You can see how it looked in Figure 7.23. At this time, temperatures were extreme and the climate became very dry. As a result, plants and animals evolved ways to cope with dryness. For example, reptiles evolved leathery skin. This helped prevent water loss. Plants evolved waxy leaves for the same purpose. The Permian Period ended with Earths second mass extinction. During this event, most of Earths species went extinct. It was the most massive extinction ever recorded. Its not clear why it happened. One possible reason is that a very large meteorite struck Earth. Another possibility is the eruption of enormous volcanoes. Either event could create a huge amount of dust. The dust might block out sunlight for months. This would cool the planet and prevent photosynthesis. </p>

        <h3>Mesozoic Era</h3>
        <p>The Permian mass extinction paved the way for another burst of new life at the start of the Mesozoic Era. This era is known as the age of dinosaurs. It is divided into three periods. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Triassic Period</h3>
        <p>During the Triassic Period, the first dinosaurs evolved from reptile ancestors. They eventually colonized the air and water in addition to the land. There were also forests of huge seed ferns and cone-bearing conifer trees in the Triassic Period. Modern corals, fish, and insects all evolved in this period as well. The supercontinent of Pangea started to break up. The Triassic Period ended in a mass extinction. The majority of species died out, but dinosaurs were spared. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Jurassic Period</h3>
        <p>The Triassic mass extinction gave dinosaurs the opportunity to really flourish during the Jurassic Period. Thats why this period is called the golden age of dinosaurs. The earliest birds also evolved during the Jurassic from dinosaur ancestors. In addition, all the major groups of mammals appeared. Flowering plants also appeared for the first time. New insects evolved to pollinate them. The continents continued to move apart. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cretaceous Period</h3>
        <p>During the Cretaceous Period, the dinosaurs reached their maximum size and distribution. For example, the well- known Tyrannosaurus rex weighed at least 7 tons! You can get an idea of how big it was from the T. rex skeleton in Figure 7.24. (Notice how small the person looks in the bottom left of the photo.) By the end of the Cretaceous, the continents were close to their present locations. The period ended with another mass extinction. This time, the dinosaurs went extinct. What happened to the dinosaurs? Some scientists think that a comet or asteroid may have crashed into Earth. This could darken the sky, shut down photosynthesis, and cause climate change. Other factors probably contributed to the mass extinction as well. </p>

        <h3>Cenozoic Era</h3>
        <p>The extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era paved the way for mammals to take over. Thats why the Cenozoic Era is called the age of mammals. They soon became the dominant land animals on Earth. The Cenozoic is divided into two periods. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Tertiary Period</h3>
        <p>During the Tertiary Period, many new kinds of mammals evolved. For example, primates and human ancestors first appeared during this period. Many mammals also increased in size. Modern rain forests and grasslands appeared. Flowering plants and insects increased in numbers. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Quaternary Period</h3>
        <p>During the Quaternary Period, the climate cooled. This caused a series of ice ages. Glaciers advanced southward from the North Pole. They reached as far south as Chicago and New York City. Sea levels fell because so much water was frozen in glaciers. This exposed land bridges between continents. The land bridges allowed land animals to move to new areas. Some mammals adapted to the cold by evolving very large size and thick fur. An example is the woolly mammoth, shown in Figure 7.25. Other mammals moved closer to the equator. Those that couldnt adapt or move went extinct, along with many plants. The last ice age ended about 12,000 years ago. By then, our own species, Homo sapiens, had evolved. After that, we were eyewitnesses to the story of life. As a result, the recent past is less of a mystery than the billions of years before it. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. The geologic time scale is used to organize the vast expanse of time since Earth formed. It is based on major events in the history of Earth and its living things. The Precambrian Supereon (4.6 billion544 million years ago) is the first major division of the geologic time scale. The first living cells may have evolved around 4 billion years ago. By 1 million years ago, the first multicellular eukaryotes had evolved. The Precambrian ended with the first of six mass extinctions that occurred during Earths history. The Paleozoic Era (544245 million years ago) started with an explosion of new kinds of organisms. Major evolutionary events during this era included the first appearance of invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Plants also colonized the land, and vascular plants and seed plants evolved. The era ended with the Permian mass extinction. The Mesozoic Era (24565 million years ago) is called the age of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs evolved from reptiles. They flourished after the Triassic mass extinction. They went extinct at the end of the era in the Cretaceous mass extinction. Birds and flowering plants also first appeared during the Mesozoic Era. The Cenozoic Era (65 million years agopresent) is called the age of mammals. Mammals became more diverse, and many increased in size. A series of ice ages affected the evolution of living things during this era. The human species evolved toward the end of the Mesozoic Era. </p>

        <p>Earth formed 4.6 billion years ago. Life first appeared on Earth about 4 billion years ago. The first life forms were microscopic, single-celled organisms. From these simple beginnings, evolution gradually produced the vast diversity of life today. In this lesson, youll read about the history of life from its origins until now. Youll learn that living things had to cope with some astounding changes. Giant meteorites struck Earths surface. Continents drifted and collided. Several times the majority of Earths living things went extinct. Extinction occurs when a species completely dies out. But life on Earth was persistent. Each time it came back more numerous and diverse than before. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows an example of geologic time scale, which is a tool that scientists and historians used to describe and understand the different time frames of the Earths existence. This geologic time scale shows a timeline of events beginning from the late Proterozoic Era, approximately 650 million years ago. It is divided into eras and periods, and lists the major events that occurred in Earths history each period. From the geologic time scale, we can tell when different creatures evolved and first appeared on Earth. We know that the first amphibians appeared during the Devonian Period in the Paleozoic Era, approximately 400 million years ago. The first dinosaurs appeared during the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, about 250 million years ago. Humans like us only appeared on Earth approximately 2.6 million years ago, during the Quaternary Period of the Cenozoic Era. The human race is very young, considering the Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old!</p>

        <p>The diagram is a representation of the major division of earths history. The geological timescale is a representation of time elapsed after the formation of earth, divided into slices, each differentiated by a geological event whose record is held in rock samples. Geological time is primarily divided into eons, which are divided into eras, which are further divided into periods. The periods are further divided into epochs, and epochs into ages, while eons are grouped into super-eons. The lengths of these eras are often measured by the term mya, which represents millions of years ago. The first three eons are grouped under the Precambrian super-eon. The fourth eon, called the Phanerozoic, is ongoing. Although the first three eons together account for most of Earthas history, stretching out for nearly four billion years, there was little of note in terms of biological activity or geological diversity. So, in representations such as the table above, they are usually collectively called the Precambrian. It contains the Hadeon eon, when Earth was forming and the Late Heavy Bombardment took place; the Archeon eon, when water first showed up and the first lifeforms evolved; the Proterozoic eon, when the first multicellular organisms appeared and Earthas atmosphere received oxygen for the first time as a result of the proliferation of cyanobacteria.</p>
