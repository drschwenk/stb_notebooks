        <h3>Radioactive Decay</h3>
        <p>Radioactivity is the tendency of certain atoms to decay into lighter atoms, a process that emits energy. Radioactivity also provides a way to find the absolute age of a rock. First, we need to know about radioactive decay. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Radioactive Isotopes</h3>
        <p>Some isotopes are radioactive; radioactive isotopes are unstable and spontaneously change by gaining or losing particles. Two types of radioactive decay are relevant to dating Earth materials (Table 1.1): Particle Alpha Composition 2 protons, 2 neutrons Beta 1 electron Effect on Nucleus The nucleus contains two fewer protons and two fewer neutrons. One neutron decays to form a pro- ton and an electron. The electron is emitted. The radioactive decay of a parent isotope (the original element) leads to the formation of stable daughter product, also known as daughter isotope. As time passes, the number of parent isotopes decreases and the number of daughter isotopes increases (Figure 1.1). </p>

        <h3>HalfLives</h3>
        <p>Radioactive materials decay at known rates, measured as a unit called half-life. The half-life of a radioactive substance is the amount of time it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay. This is how the material decays over time (see Table 1.2). No. of half lives passed 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Percent parent remaining 100 50 25 12.5 6.25 3.125 1.563 0.781 0.391 Percent daughter produced 0 50 75 87.5 93.75 96.875 98.437 99.219 99.609 Pretend you find a rock with 3.125% parent atoms and 96.875% daughter atoms. How many half lives have passed? If the half-life of the parent isotope is 1 year, then how old is the rock? The decay of radioactive materials can be shown with a graph (Figure 1.2). Notice how it doesnt take too many half lives before there is very little parent remaining and most of the isotopes are daughter isotopes. This limits how many half lives can pass before a radioactive element is no longer useful for Decay of an imaginary radioactive sub- stance with a half-life of one year. dating materials. Fortunately, different isotopes have very different half lives. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>A half life is the time it takes for half of the parent isotopes of an element to change to daughter isotopes. With alpha decay, the nucleus loses two protons and two neutrons; with beta decay only one electron is lost. Radiometric decay is exponential. </p>

        <p>Gamma decay is the process by which the nucleus of an atom emits a high energy photon, that is, extremely short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation. It is one of three major types of radioactivity (the other two being alpha decay and beta decay). Gamma decay is similar to the emission of light (usually visible light) by decay in the orbits of the electrons surrounding the nucleus. In each case the energy states, and the wavelengths of the emitted radiation, are governed by the law of quantum mechanics. But while the electron orbits have relatively low energy, the nuclear states have much higher energy. Gamma decay is a process of emission of gamma rays that accompanies other forms of radioactive decay, such as alpha and beta decay. Nuclei are not normally in excited states, so gamma radiation is typically incidental to alpha or beta decay the alpha or beta decay leaves the nucleus in an excited state, and gamma decay happens soon afterwards. Gamma radiation is the most penetrating of the three kinds. Gamma ray photons can travel through several centimeters of aluminum.</p>

        <p>The diagram below shows the beta decay of carbon 14. The carbon-14 nucleus has a neutron within it change into a proton Then we see both a beta minus particle (an electron with high kinetic energy) and an antineutrino ejected from the nucleus. Carbon 14 has two extra neutrons in its nucleus and that is a higher energy configuration and is a bit unstable, so it can release an electron and have a neutron turn into a proton-forming Nitrogen 14 instead, which is more stable.</p>

        <p>The following diagram provides an example of Alpha Decay, where a Radium atom transforms or decays into a radon atom. Alpha decay is a type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into an atom with a mass number that is reduced by four and an atomic number that is reduced by two. Alpha decay only occurs in very heavy elements such as uranium, thorium and radium. The nuclei of these atoms are very neutron rich (i.e. have a lot more neutrons in their nucleus than they do protons) which makes emission of the alpha particle possible. After an atom ejects an alpha particle, a new parent atom is formed which has two fewer neutrons and two fewer protons. Thus, when Radium-226 decays by alpha emission, Radon-222 is created.</p>
