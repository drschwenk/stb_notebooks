        <h3>Functions of the Male Reproductive System</h3>
        <p>The male reproductive system has two main functions: producing sperm and releasing testosterone. Sperm are male gametes, or reproductive cells. Sperm form when certain cells in the male reproductive system divide by meiosis to form haploid cells. Being haploid means they have half the number of chromosomes of other cells in the body. An adult male may produce millions of sperm each day! Testosterone is the major sex hormone in males. Testosterone has two primary roles: 1. During adolescence, testosterone causes most of the changes associated with puberty. It causes the reproduc- tive organs to mature. It also causes other adult male traits to develop. For example, it causes the voice to deepen and facial hair to start growing. 2. During adulthood, testosterone is needed for the production of sperm. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Organs of the Male Reproductive System</h3>
        <p>The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and prostate gland. These organs are shown in Figure 22.1. The figure also shows some other parts of the male reproductive system. Find each organ in the drawing as you read about it below. For a cartoon about the male reproductive system, watch this video: http MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The penis is an external, cylinder-shaped organ that contains the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body. It also carries sperm out of the body. The two testes (testis, singular) are oval organs that produce sperm and secrete testosterone. They are located inside a sac called the scrotum that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 22.1 Male reproductive system as viewed from the side The epididymis is a tube that is about 6 meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm mature. It stores the sperm until they leave the body. The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. Semen is a whitish liquid that contains sperm. It passes through the urethra and out of the body.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Producing Sperm</h3>
        <p>Sperm are tiny cells. In fact, they are the smallest of all human cells. They have a structure that suits them well to perform their function. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure and Function of Sperm</h3>
        <p>As you can see in Figure 22.2, a sperm has three main parts: the head, connecting piece (or midpiece), and tail. 1. The head of the sperm contains the nucleus. The nucleus holds the chromosomes. In humans, the nucleus of a sperm cell contains 23 chromosomes. The acrosome on the head contains enzymes that help the sperm penetrate an egg. 2. The connecting piece of the sperm is packed with mitochondria. Mitochondria are organelles in cells that produce energy. Sperm use the energy to move. 3. The tail of the sperm moves like a propeller. It spins around and around and pushes the sperm forward. Sperm can travel about 30 inches per hour. </p>

        <h3>How Sperm Form</h3>
        <p>It takes up to two months for mature sperm to form. The process occurs in several steps: 1. Special cells in the testes go through mitosis to make identical copies of themselves. 2. The copies of the original cells divide by meiosis. This results in haploid cells called spermatids. These cells lack tails and cannot yet swim. 3. Spermatids move from the testes to the epididymis, where they slowly mature. For example, they grow a tail and lose some of the cytoplasm from the head. 4. Once sperm are mature, they can swim. The mature sperm remain in the epididymis until it is time for them to leave the body. Sperm leave the epididymis through the vas deferens. As they travel through the vas deferens, they pass by the prostate and other glands. The sperm mix with secretions from these glands, forming semen. Semen travels through the urethra and leaves the body through the penis. A teaspoon of semen may contain as many as half a billion sperm! </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. A man who doesnt want to have any more children may have a procedure in which the vas deferens is cut. Why does this procedure prohibit him from having more children? </p>

        <p>Identify functions of the male reproductive system.
Describe organs of the male reproductive system.

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The male reproductive system has two main functions: producing sperm and secreting testosterone. Sperm are male gametes. Testosterone is the major sex hormone in males. The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, epididymis, vas deferens, and prostate gland. Sperm form in the testes and mature in the epididymis. Each sperm has three main parts: head, connecting piece, and tail. Sperm mix with secretions from glands to form semen. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Dogs have puppies. Cats have kittens. All living things reproduce, including human beings. Like other mammals, human beings have a body system that controls reproduction. Its called the reproductive system. Its the only human body system that differs significantly between males and females. The male and female reproductive systems have different organs and different functions. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What are the two main roles of the male reproductive system? 2. Name three male reproductive organs, and identify their reproductive functions. 3. What are sperm? What is the function of the tail of a sperm? </p>

        <p>This image shows the posterior view of female reproductive system. The female reproductive system (or female genital system) is made up of the internal and external sex organs that function in human reproduction. The female reproductive system is immature at birth and develops to maturity at puberty to be able to produce gametes, and to carry a fetus to full term. The internal sex organs are the uterus and Fallopian tubes, and the ovaries. The uterus or womb accommodates the embryo which develops into the fetus. The uterus also produces vaginal and uterine secretions which help the transit of sperm to the Fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce the ova (egg cells). The external sex organs are also known as the genitals and these are the organs of the vulva including the labia, clitoris and vaginal opening. The vagina is connected to the uterus at the cervix.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the parts and organs of the male reproductive system. The male reproductive organs include the penis, testes, epididymis, Ductus (vas) deferens, and prostate gland. The penis is an external, cylinder-shaped organ that contains the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body. It also carries sperm out of the body. The testis (testis, singular) are oval organs that produce sperm and secrete testosterone. They are located inside a sac called the scrotum that hangs down outside the body. The scrotum also contains the epididymis. The epididymis is a tube that is about 6 meters (20 feet) long in adults. It is tightly coiled, so it fits inside the scrotum on top of the testes. The epididymis is where sperm mature. It stores the sperm until they leave the body. The vas deferens is a tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. The prostate gland secretes a fluid that mixes with sperm to help form semen. Semen is a whitish liquid that contains sperm. It passes through the urethra and out of the body. Also shown are some parts of the digestive system like the rectum and anus.</p>
