        <h3>Flatworms</h3>
        <p>Flatworms are invertebrates that belong to Phylum Platyhelminthes. There are more than 25,000 species in the flatworm phylum. Not all flatworms are as long as tapeworms. Some are only about a millimeter in length. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Flatworm Adaptations</h3>
        <p>Flatworms have a flat body because they lack a fluid-filled body cavity. They also have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. However, flatworms represent several evolutionary advances in invertebrates. They have the following adaptations: Flatworms have three embryonic cell layers. They have a mesoderm layer in addition to ectoderm and endoderm layers. The mesoderm layer allows flatworms to develop muscle tissues so they can move easily over solid surfaces. Flatworms have a concentration of nerve tissue in the head end. This was a major step in the evolution of a brain. It was also needed for bilateral symmetry. Flatworms have bilateral symmetry. This gives them a better sense of direction than radial symmetry would.

        </p>
        <h3>How Flatworms Reproduce</h3>
        <p>Flatworms reproduce sexually. In most species, the same individuals produce both eggs and sperm. After fertilization occurs, the fertilized eggs pass out of the adults body and hatch into larvae. There may be several different larval stages. The final larval stage develops into the adult form. Then the life cycle repeats. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ecology of Flatworms</h3>
        <p>Some flatworms live in water or moist soil. They eat invertebrates and decaying animals. Other flatworms, such as tapeworms, are parasites that live inside vertebrate hosts. Usually, more than one type of host is needed to complete the parasites life cycle, as shown in Figure 12.12. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Roundworms</h3>
        <p>Roundworms are invertebrates in Phylum Nematoda. This is a very diverse phylum. It has more than 80,000 known species. Roundworms range in length from less than 1 millimeter to over 7 meters in length. You can see an example of a roundworm in Figure 12.13. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Roundworm Adaptations</h3>
        <p>Roundworms have a round body because they have a partial fluid-filled body cavity (pseudocoelom). This is one way that roundworms differ from flatworms. Another way is their complete digestive system. It allows them to eat, digest food, and eliminate wastes all at the same time. Roundworms have a tough covering of cuticle on the surface of their body. It prevents their body from expanding. This allows the buildup of fluid pressure in their partial body cavity. The fluid pressure adds stiffness to the body. This provides a counterforce for the contraction of muscles, allowing roundworms to move easily over surfaces. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Roundworm Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Roundworms reproduce sexually. Sperm and eggs are produced by separate male and female adults. Fertilization takes place inside the female organism. Females lay huge numbers of eggs, sometimes as many as 100,000 per day! The eggs hatch into larvae, which develop into adults. Then the life cycle repeats. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How Roundworms Make a Living</h3>
        <p>Roundworms may be free-living or parasitic organisms. Free-living worms are found mainly in freshwater habitats. Some live in moist soil. They generally feed on bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or decaying organic matter. By breaking down organic matter, they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Parasitic roundworms may have plant, invertebrate, or vertebrate hosts. Several roundworm species infect humans. Besides ascaris, they include hookworms. Hookworms are named for the hooks they use to grab onto the hosts intestines. You can see the hooks in Figure 12.14. Hookworm larvae enter the host through the skin. They migrate to the intestine, where they mature into adults. Female adults lay large quantities of eggs. Eggs pass out of the host in feces. Eggs hatch into larvae in the feces or soil. Then the cycle repeats. You can learn more about parasitic roundworms in humans by watching this short video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In the next lesson, youll read about worms called annelids. Mollusks such as snails are also described in the next lesson. 1. How do you think annelids might be different from flatworms and roundworms? 2. Why do you think annelids are placed in a lesson with mollusks instead of with flatworms and roundworms? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Thats not a tape measure in Figure 12.11. Its a tapeworm! A tapeworm may grow to more than 20 meters in lengthall while living inside a human intestine! A tapeworm is a type of flatworm. Many flatworms are parasites, as youll learn in this lesson. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows the earthworm anatomy. The segmented body parts provide important structural functions. Segmentation can help the earthworm move. Each segment or section has muscles and bristles called setae. The bristles or setae help anchor and control the worm when moving through soil. The bristles hold a section of the worm firmly into the ground while the other part of the body protrudes forward. The earthworm uses segments to either contract or relax independently to cause the body to lengthen in one area or contract in other areas. Segmentation helps the worm to be flexible and strong in its movement. If each segment moved together without being independent, the earthworm would be stationary.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the earthworm's internal anatomy with its key parts and definitions. An earthworm is a tube-shaped, segmented worm found in the phylum Annelida. The body of the earthworm is segmented which looks like many little rings joined or fused together. Segmentation helps the worm to be flexible and strong in its movement. An earthworm's digestive system runs through the length of its body. The digestive system consists of the mouth, the crop, the gut and the gizzard. Earthworms are hermaphrodites where each earthworm contains both male and female sex organs. Some other key features of the earthworm include its brain, which consists of a large cluster of nerve cells connected to a ventral nerve cord which runs the length of the body, and its heart, which is a set of typically five muscular swellings that pump blood through their bodies.</p>
