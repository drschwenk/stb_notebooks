        <h3>What Are Arthropods</h3>
        <p>Arthropods are invertebrates in Phylum Arthropoda. There are more than a million known species of arthropods. However, scientists estimate that only about a tenth of all arthropod species have been identified. In addition to insects, arthropods include animals such as spiders, centipedes, and lobsters. You can see why arthropods were successful both in the water and on land, by watching these excellent videos: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  There are several traits shared by all arthropods. Arthropods have a complete digestive system. They also have a circulatory system and a nervous system. In addition, they have special organs for breathing and excreting wastes. Other traits of arthropods include: segmented body; hard exoskeleton; and jointed appendages. </p>

        <h3>Body Segments of Arthropods</h3>
        <p>Most arthropods have three body segments. The segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen. You can see the three segments in a range of arthropods in Figure 12.21. In some arthropods, the head and thorax are joined together. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Arthropod Exoskeleton</h3>
        <p>The exoskeleton (or external skeleton) of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss. It also protects and supports the body. In addition, it acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows. Eventually, it must be shed and replaced with a new one. This happens periodically throughout an arthropods life. The shedding of the exoskeleton is called molting. You can see a time-lapse video of an insect molting at this link: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cicada_moltin </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Arthropod Appendages</h3>
        <p>Because arthropod appendages are jointed, they can bend. This makes them flexible. Jointed appendages on the body are usually used as legs for walking or jumping. Jointed appendages on the head may be modified for other purposes. Head appendages often include upper and lower jaws. Jaws are used for eating and may also be used for defense. Sensory organs such as eyes and antennae are also found on the head. You can see some of these head appendages on the bee in Figure 12.22. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Arthropod Life Cycles</h3>
        <p>Arthropods reproduce sexually. Male and female adults produce gametes. If fertilization occurs, eggs hatch into offspring. After hatching, most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood. The larvae may look very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the arthropod is called a pupa. It may or may not spend this stage inside a special container called a cocoon. A familiar example of arthropod metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult) (see Figure 12.23). Distinctive life stages and metamorphosis are highly adaptive. They allow functions to be divided among different life stages. Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages. In some arthropods, newly hatched offspring look like small adults. These arthropods dont go through larval stages. They just grow larger until they reach adult size. This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis. You can see incomplete metamorphosis in a grasshopper in Figure 12.24. </p>

        <h3>Insects</h3>
        <p>The majority of arthropods are insects (Class Insecta). In fact, more than half of all known organisms are insects. There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world, although most of them have not yet been identified. In terms of their numbers and diversity, insects clearly are the dominant animals in the world. </p>

        <h3>Insect Traits</h3>
        <p>Like other arthropods, insects have three body segments and many jointed appendages. The abdomen contains most of the internal organs. Six legs are attached to the thorax. There are several appendages on the insects head: The head has a pair of antennae. Insects use their antennae to smell and taste chemicals. Some insects can also use their antennae to hear sounds. The head generally has several simple eyes and a pair of compound eyes. Simple eyes have a single lens, like the human eye. Compound eyes have many lenses. For feeding, the insect head contains one pair of lower jaws and two pairs of upper jaws. Insects have also evolved a wide range of specialized mouthparts for eating certain foods. You can see some examples in Figure </p>

        <h3>Insect Flight</h3>
        <p>The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly. They were also the first animals to evolve flight. The ability to fly is highly adaptive. Its a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. Its also useful for finding food and mates. Insects that fly have wings, like the dragonfly in Figure 12.26. Insects generally have two pairs of wings. They are attached to the thorax. The wings form from the exoskeleton.

        <h3>Insects and People</h3>
        <p>Most humans interact with insects every day. Many of these interactions are harmless and often go unnoticed. However, insects can also cause humans a lot of harm. Some insects are vectors for human diseases. The mosquito in Figure 12.27 is a vector for malaria. Malaria kills millions of people each year. Many other insects feed on food crops. Growers may need to apply chemical pesticides to control them. On the other hand, without insects to pollinate them, many flowering plants, including important food crops, could not reproduce. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>4. It might be said of insects that we cant live with them or without them. Do you agree or disagree? Apply lesson concepts to explain why. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Arthropods are invertebrates in the Phylum Arthropoda. They include insects, spiders, centipedes, and lob- sters. Traits of arthropods include three body segments, a hard exoskeleton, and jointed appendages. The arthropod life cycle may include larva and pupa stages and the process of metamorphosis. The majority of arthropods are insects. All insects have six legs and multiple head appendages and sensory organs. The main reason for the success of insects is the ability of many insects to fly. Insects both help and harm human beings. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the life cycle of a Frog. Frogs belong to species of animals called amphibians, meaning they can live in land or in water. Adult frogs lay their eggs in water or wet places. A floating clump of eggs is called a frog spawn. The egg begins as a single cell. Several thousand are sometimes laid at once. It becomes surrounded by a jellylike covering, which protects the egg. The egg slowly develops for a period of about 21 days and becomes a tadpole, a baby frog. The tadpole has a long tail, and lives in the water. After about five weeks, the tadpole begins to transform. It starts to grow hind legs, which are soon followed with forelegs. Behind their heads bulges appear where their front legs are growing and their tails become smaller. The tadpole becomes a froglet. Froglets continue to live in water and continue to develop. Over time, the tadpole becomes even more frog-like. They shed their skin and lips. Its mouth widens, and it loses its horny jaws. The tail becomes much smaller, and the legs grow. As they become adult frogs, the life cycle then continues.</p>

There are more than a million known species of arthropods. In addition to insects, arthropods include animals such as spiders, centipedes, and lobsters. Arthropods reproduce sexually. Male and female adults produce gametes or eggs. If fertilization occurs, eggs hatch into offspring. After hatching, most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood. The larvae may look very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the arthropod is called a pupa.

Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages. In some arthropods, newly hatched offspring look like small adults. These arthropods don't go through larval stages. They just grow larger until they reach adult size.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the life cycle of a butterfly. A butterfly lays eggs on leaves or plants. Then, the eggs hatch into larva. This larva grow to full-sized caterpillars. The caterpillars form pupa, or cocoons. Within a few weeks, the pupa begins to unravel and a butterfly emerges. Later, the butterfly will lay eggs and the cycle will begin again. This cycle generally takes less than 4-6 weeks to complete.</p>

        <p>The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a butterfly. It begins as adult butterflies lay their eggs. The egg is a tiny, round, oval, or cylindrical object, usually with fine ribs and other microscopic structures. The female attaches the egg to leaves, stems, or other objects, usually on or near the intended caterpillar food. After sometime the caterpillar hatches from the eggs. The caterpillar (or larva) is the long, worm-like stage of the butterfly. It often has a colorful pattern of stripes or patches, and it may have spine-like hairs. It feeds on plant leaves and as it grows, it sheds its skin four or more times to enclose it's rapidly growing body. After the caterpillar has grown big enough, they form themselves into a Chrysalis (or pupa). It is the transformation stage within which the caterpillar transforms into an adult butterfly by a process called metamorphosis.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the life cycle of an arthropod. The majority of arthropods are insects. The life cycle of an arthropod can be broken down into seven stages. The first stage is Egg Mass, which can take 6-9 days to hatch. Next, comes the five nymphal stages of growth. This can take 16-18 days to complete. In some arthropods, newly hatched offspring look like small adults. These arthropods don't go through larval stages. They just grow larger until they reach adult size. This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis. After this, the arthropod becomes an adult. The adult can now lay a new set of eggs, starting another life cycle.</p>
