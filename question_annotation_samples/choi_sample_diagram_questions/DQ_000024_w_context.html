        <h3>How Flowing Water Causes Erosion and Deposition</h3>
        <p>Flowing water is a very important agent of erosion. Flowing water can erode rocks and soil. Water dissolves minerals from rocks and carries the ions. This process happens really slowly. But over millions of years, flowing water dissolves massive amounts of rock. Moving water also picks up and carries particles of soil and rock. The ability to erode is affected by the velocity, or speed, of the water. The size of the eroded particles depends on the velocity of the water. Eventually, the water deposits the materials. As water slows, larger particles are deposited. As the water slows even more, smaller particles are deposited. The graph in Figure 10.1 shows how water velocity and particle size influence erosion and deposition. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 10.1 Flowing water erodes or deposits parti- cles depending on how fast the water is moving and how big the particles are.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Water Speed and Erosion</h3>
        <p>Faster-moving water has more energy. Therefore, it can carry larger particles. It can carry more particles. What causes water to move faster? The slope of the land over which the water flows is one factor. The steeper the slope, the faster the water flows. Another factor is the amount of water thats in the stream. Streams with a lot of water flow faster than streams that are nearly dry. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Particle Size and Erosion</h3>
        <p>The size of particles determines how they are carried by flowing water. This is illustrated in Figure 10.2. Minerals that dissolve in water form salts. The salts are carried in solution. They are mixed thoroughly with the water. Small particles, such as clay and silt, are carried in suspension. They are mixed throughout the water. These particles are not dissolved in the water. Somewhat bigger particles, such as sand, are moved by saltation. The particles move in little jumps near the stream bottom. They are nudged along by water and other particles. The biggest particles, including gravel and pebbles, are moved by traction. In this process, the particles roll or drag along the bottom of the water. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Deposition by Water</h3>
        <p>Flowing water slows down when it reaches flatter land or flows into a body of still water. What do you think happens then? The water starts dropping the particles it was carrying. As the water slows, it drops the largest particles first. The smallest particles settle out last. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Erosion and Deposition by Surface Water</h3>
        <p>Water that flows over Earths surface includes runoff, streams, and rivers. All these types of flowing water can cause erosion and deposition. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Erosion by Runoff</h3>
        <p>When a lot of rain falls in a short period of time, much of the water is unable to soak into the ground. Instead, it runs over the land. Gravity causes the water to flow from higher to lower ground. As the runoff flows, it may pick up loose material on the surface, such as bits of soil and sand. Runoff is likely to cause more erosion if the land is bare. Plants help hold the soil in place. The runoff water in Figure 10.3 is brown because it eroded soil from a bare, sloping field. Can you find evidence of erosion by runoff where you live? What should you look for? Much of the material eroded by runoff is carried into bodies of water, such as streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, or oceans. Runoff is an important cause of erosion. Thats because it occurs over so much of Earths surface. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Erosion by Mountain Streams</h3>
        <p>Streams often start in mountains, where the land is very steep. You can see an example in Figure 10.4. A mountain stream flows very quickly because of the steep slope. This causes a lot of erosion and very little deposition. The rapidly falling water digs down into the stream bed and makes it deeper. It carves a narrow, V-shaped channel. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How a Waterfall Forms</h3>
        <p>Mountain streams may erode waterfalls. As shown in Figure 10.5, a waterfall forms where a stream flows from an area of harder to softer rock. The water erodes the softer rock faster than the harder rock. This causes the stream bed to drop down, like a step, creating a waterfall. As erosion continues, the waterfall gradually moves upstream. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Erosion by SlowFlowing Rivers</h3>
        <p>Rivers flowing over gentle slopes erode the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Large curves, called meanders, form because of erosion and deposition by the moving water. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. You can see how this happens in Figure 10.6. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake, like the one in Figure 10.6. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Deposition by Streams and Rivers</h3>
        <p>When a stream or river slows down, it starts dropping its sediments. Larger sediments are dropped in steep areas, but smaller sediments can still be carried. Smaller sediments are dropped as the slope becomes less steep. Alluvial Fans In arid regions, a mountain stream may flow onto flatter land. The stream comes to a stop rapidly. The deposits form an alluvial fan, like the one in Figure 10.7. Deltas Deposition also occurs when a stream or river empties into a large body of still water. In this case, a delta forms. A delta is shaped like a triangle. It spreads out into the body of water. An example is shown in Figure 10.7. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Deposition by Flood Waters</h3>
        <p>A flood occurs when a river overflows it banks. This might happen because of heavy rains. Floodplains As the water spreads out over the land, it slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, the floodplain develops a thick layer of rich soil because of all the deposits. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. For example, the Nile River in Egypt provides both water and thick sediments for raising crops in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks. A levee is a raised strip of sediments deposited close to the waters edge. You can see how levees form in Figure 10.8. Levees occur because floodwaters deposit their biggest sediments first when they overflow the rivers banks. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Erosion and Deposition by Groundwater</h3>
        <p>Some water soaks into the ground. It travels down through tiny holes in soil. It seeps through cracks in rock. The water moves slowly, pulled deeper and deeper by gravity. Underground water can also erode and deposit material. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Caves</h3>
        <p>As groundwater moves through rock, it dissolves minerals. Some rocks dissolve more easily than others. Over time, the water may dissolve large underground holes, or caves. Groundwater drips from the ceiling to the floor of a cave. This water is rich in dissolved minerals. When the minerals come out of solution, they are deposited. They build up on the ceiling of the cave to create formations called stalactites. A stalactite is a pointed, icicle-like mineral deposit that forms on the ceiling of a cave. They drip to the floor of the cave and harden to form stalagmites. A stalagmite is a more rounded mineral deposit that forms on the floor of a cave (Figure 10.9). Both types of formations grow in size as water keeps dripping and more minerals are deposited. </p>
        
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Sinkholes</h3>
        <p>As erosion by groundwater continues, the ceiling of a cave may collapse. The rock and soil above it sink into the ground. This forms a sinkhole on the surface. You can see an example of a sinkhole in Figure 10.10. Some sinkholes are big enough to swallow vehicles and buildings. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>

Describe how runoff, streams, and rivers change Earths surface.
Identify features caused by groundwater erosion and deposition.

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment, starting with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment and carries most of it to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers creates broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits that build up in caves as water continues to drip. </p>

        <p>The diagram represents the coastal Erosion of a headland. A headland is an area of hard rock which sticks out into the sea. Headlands form in areas of alternating hard and soft rock. Where the soft rock erodes, bays are formed on either side of the headland. As the headland becomes more exposed to the wind and waves the rate of its erosion increases. When headlands erode they create distinct features such as caves, arches, stacks and stumps. The sequence in the erosion of a headland is as follows: 1. Waves attack a weakness in the headland. 2. A cave is formed. 3. Eventually the cave erodes through the headland to form an arch. 4. The roof of the arch collapses leaving a column of rock called a stack. 5. The stack collapses leaving a stump.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows how a waterfall is formed by erosion. Waterfalls begin with mountain streams that begin high up in mountains. These streams flow down very quickly because of the steep slope, and flowing water, especially fast-moving water, erodes soil and rocks. Soft rock erodes more quickly than hard rock. When soft rock erodes, the stream bed can collapse, causing an abrupt drop in the stream. This sudden drop is what creates a waterfall. In the diagram, the overhang is where the stream bed collapsed to create the waterfall. Because of the flowing water, the soft rock at the side of the waterfall will continue to erode. This continued erosion will cause more of the stream bed to collapse. The waterfall overhang will then retreat upstream and create a higher waterfall.</p>
