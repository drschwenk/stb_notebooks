        <h3>Excretion</h3>
        <p>So what happens to your bodys wastes? Obviously, you must get rid of them. This is the job of the excretory system. You remove waste as a gas (carbon dioxide), as a liquid (urine and sweat), and as a solid. Excretion is the process of removing wastes and excess water from the body. Recall that carbon dioxide travels through the blood and is transferred to the lungs where it is exhaled. In the large intestine, the remains of food are turned into solid waste for excretion. How is waste other than carbon dioxide removed from the blood? That is the role of the kidneys. Urine is a liquid waste formed by the kidneys as they filter the blood. If you are getting plenty of fluids, your urine should be almost clear. But you might have noticed that sometimes your urine is darker than usual. Do you know why this happens? Sometimes your body is low on water and trying to reduce the amount of water lost in urine. Therefore, your urine gets darker than usual. Your body is striving to maintain homeostasis through the process of excretion. Urine helps remove excess water, salts, and nitrogen from your body. Your body also needs to remove the wastes that build up from cell activity and from digestion. If these wastes are not removed, your cells can stop working, and you can get very sick. The organs of your excretory system help to release wastes from the body. The organs of the excretory system are also parts of other organ systems. For example, your lungs are part of the respiratory system. Your lungs remove carbon dioxide from your body, so they are also part of the excretory system. More organs of the excretory system are listed below ( Table 1.1). Organ(s) Function Lungs Skin Remove carbon dioxide. Sweat glands remove water, salts, and other wastes. Removes solid waste and some wa- ter in the form of feces. Remove urea, salts, and excess wa- ter from the blood.

        <p>This is the diagram representing the human excretory system. The excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess, unnecessary materials from the body fluids of an organism, to help maintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. It has following parts: The aorta begins at the top of the left ventricle, the heart's muscular pumping chamber. The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart. The kidneys are bean-shaped organs which are present on each side of the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity. The kidney's primary function is the elimination of waste from the bloodstream by production of urine. The ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. The urinary bladder is the organ that collects waste excreted by the kidneys prior to disposal by urination. Urethra is a tube which connects the urinary bladder to the outside of the body.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the human urinary system. It includes two kidneys, two ureters and a urinary bladder. Blood is filtered by the kidneys to remove waste. Excess water and waste leaves the kidneys in the form of urine through the ureters to the bladder. Contractions of muscles in the ureters move the urine down into the bladder. Urine is excreted from the bladder through the urethra by the process of urination.</p>

        <p>This is a diagram of the major organs of the excretory system. The kidneys, ureter, bladder, and urethra all play important roles in this system. The kidneys filter blood and produce urine. The kidneys are shaped like beans and are located on each side of the body. After the kidneys, urine enters into the ureter. Then the urine moves into the bladder. When the bladder is about half full, it then releases into the urethra. This is how urine is filtered out of the body.</p>
