      <ul>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Effects of Pollutants</h3>
        <p>All air pollutants are harmful. Thats why theyre called pollutants. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Particulates</h3>
        <p>Particulates cause lung diseases. They can also increase the risk of heart disease and the number of asthma attacks. Particulates block sunlight from reaching Earths surface. This means there is less energy for photosynthesis. Less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food. This affects whole ecosystems. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ozone</h3>
        <p>The ozone in smog may damage plants. The effects of ozone add up over time. Plants such as trees, which normally live a long time, are most affected. Entire forests may die out if ozone levels are very high. Other plants, including crop plants, may also be damaged by ozone. You can see evidence of ozone damage in Figure 22.5. The ozone in smog is also harmful to human health. Figure 22.6 shows the levels of ozone to watch out for. Some people are especially sensitive to ozone. They can be harmed by levels of ozone that would not affect most other people. These people include those with lung or heart problems. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Nitrogen and Sulfur Oxides</h3>
        <p>Both nitrogen and sulfur oxides are toxic to humans. These compounds can cause lung diseases or make them worse. Nitrogen and sulfur oxides form acid rain, which is described below. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Carbon Monoxide</h3>
        <p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is toxic to both plants and animals. CO is deadly to people in a confined space, such as a closed home. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so people cant tell when they are breathing it. Thats why homes should have carbon monoxide detectors. You can see one in Figure 22.7. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Heavy Metals</h3>
        <p>Heavy metals, such as mercury and lead, are toxic to living things. They can enter food chains from the atmosphere. The metals build up in the tissues of organisms by bioaccumulation. Bioaccumulation is illustrated in Figure 22.8. As heavy metals are passed up a food chain they accumulate. Imagine a low-level consumer eating a producer. That consumer takes in all of the heavy metals from all of the producers that it eats. Then a higher-level consumer eats it and accumulates all the heavy metals from all of the lower-level consumers that it eats. In this way, heavy metals may accumulate. At high levels in the food chain, the heavy metals may be quite become quite concentrated. The higher up a food chain that humans eat, the greater the levels of toxic metals they take in. Thats why people should avoid eating too much of large fish such as tuna. Tuna are predators near the top of their food chains. They have been shown to contain high levels of mercury. In people, heavy metals can damage the brain and other organs. Unborn babies and young children are most affected. Thats because their organs are still developing. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>VOCs</h3>
        <p>VOCs are toxic to humans and other living things. In people, they can cause a wide range of problems, from eye and nose irritation to brain damage and cancer. Levels of VOCs are often higher indoors than out. Thats because they are released by products such as paints, cleaning solutions, and building materials. How might you reduce your exposure to VOCs? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Acid Rain</h3>
        <p>Acid rain is rain that has a pH less than 5 (see Figure 22.9). The pH of normal rain is 5.6. Its slightly acidic because carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rain. This forms carbonic acid, a weak acid. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p><img src="../../textbook_images/effects_of_air_pollution_20327.png" width=500px></p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How Acid Rain Forms</h3>
        <p>Acid rain forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides in air dissolve in rain (see Figure 22.10). This forms nitric and sulfuric acids. Both are strong acids. Acid rain with a pH as low as 4.0 is now common in many areas. Acid fog may be even more acidic than acid rain. Fog with a pH as low as 1.7 has been recorded. Thats the same pH as toilet bowl cleaner! </p>

        <h3>Effects of Acid Rain</h3>
        <p>Figure 22.11 shows some of the damage done by acid rain. Acid rain ends up in soil and bodies of water. This can make them very acidic. The acid strips soil of its nutrients. These changes can kill trees, fish, and other living things. Acid rain also dissolves limestone and marble. This can damage buildings, monuments, and statues. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Loss of HighLevel Ozone</h3>
        <p>Ozone near the ground harms human health. But the ozone layer in the stratosphere protects us from solar rays. Thats why people were alarmed in the 1980s to learn that there was a hole in the ozone layer. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Cause of Ozone Loss</h3>
        <p>Whats destroying the ozone layer? The chief cause is chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). These are human-made chemicals that contain the element chlorine (Cl). In the past, CFCs were widely used in spray cans, refrigerators, and many other products. CFCs are stable compounds that can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Once CFCs are in the air, they float up into the stratosphere. What happens next is shown in Figure 22.12. Sunlight breaks apart the molecules. This releases their chlorine atoms (Cl). The free chlorine atoms may then combine with oxygen atoms in ozone. This breaks down the ozone molecules into an oxygen molecule and an oxygen atom. One CFC molecule can break down as many as 100,000 ozone molecules in this way! These forms of oxygen do not protect the planet from ultraviolet radiation. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Ozone Hole</h3>
        <p>Most ozone loss it taking place over the South Pole and Antarctica. This is the location of the ozone hole. The ozone hole is also seasonal. The hole forms during the early part spring in the Southern Hemisphere and then grows northward. You can see the hole in Figure 22.13. Besides the ozone hole, the ozone layer is thinner over the Northern Hemisphere. </p>
        
        <p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Effects of Ozone Loss</h3>
        <p>With less ozone in the stratosphere, more UV rays reach the ground. More UV rays increase skin cancer rates. Just a 1 percent loss of ozone causes a 5 percent increase in skin cancer. More UV rays also harm plants and phytoplankton. As a result, they produce less food. This may affect entire ecosystems. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>7. Chloe has asthma, so she is sensitive to air pollution. Today, the ozone air quality index in her city is 100 ppm. Should Chloe be concerned? Why or why not? 8. Create an original diagram to show how CFCs affect the ozone layer. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Outline the effects of pollutants in the air.
Identify the cause and effects of acid rain.
Relate air pollution to loss of the ozone layer.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>All air pollutants can be harmful. Some damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. For example, particulates reduce sunlight for photosynthesis. Ozone kills forests. Both harm human health. Acid rain is rain that has a pH less than 5. It forms when nitrogen and sulfur oxides dissolve in rain. Acid rain kills living things and damages buildings and statues. CFCs destroy ozone in the stratosphere. This lets more UV light strike Earth. The UV light causes skin cancer. It also harms plants and phytoplankton. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Think Critically</h3>
        <p>9. Explain how acid rain forms. Infer how it could be reduced. 10. Relate air pollution to global warming. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from it each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. Thats because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. How do particulates affect human health? 2. State why ozone is more harmful to plants that normally live a long time. 3. Define bioaccumulation. Name two air pollutants that bioaccumulate. 4. Why should you limit the amount of tuna that you eat? 5. What are some products around the house that might expose you to VOCs? 6. Describe the effects of acid rain. </p>

        <p>This diagram depicts how the acid rain forms. There are factories, vegetation, houses, river and ocean in the picture. Houses and venation is on the earth's surface. First, the acidic gases are emitted from the factories. Those acid gases include sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. The acid gases are included in cloud forming process by wind. The clouds containing acid gases dissolve in rainwater to form the acid rain. The acid rain poured to the earth's surface. The acid rain is absorbed to the earth and is flowing to the river. Now, the river contains the acid rain. The river flows to the ocean. The river of acid rain kills plantlife, pollutes rivers and streams, and erodes stonework. This process continues as long as the factories emit the acid gases.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows how acid rain is caused by air pollution. Acid rain is mainly caused when air pollutants such as sulphur and nitrogen oxides mix with water vapor in the atmosphere. Nitrogen and sulphur oxides are generated on the earth's surface by man-made sources such as factories. A natural source of nitrogen oxides are volcanoes. These air pollutants generated then move upwards into the earth's atmosphere and get deposited back on the earth as dry or wet deposits. Wet deposits happen when gases and particulate matter mixes with water vapor which causes acid-rain/precipitation. Dry deposits come back to earth in the form of acidic gases and particulate matter.</p>
