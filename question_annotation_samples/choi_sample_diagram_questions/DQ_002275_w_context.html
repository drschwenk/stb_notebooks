        <h3>Characteristics and Importance of Soil</h3>
        <p>We can think about soil as a living resource. Soil is an ecosystem all by itself! Soil is a complex mixture of different materials. Some of them are inorganic. Inorganic materials are made from non-living substances like pebbles and sand. Soil also contains bits of organic materials from plants and animals. In general, about half of the soil is made of pieces of rock and minerals. The other half is organic materials. In the spaces of soil are millions of living organisms. These include earthworms, ants, bacteria, and fungi. In some soils, the organic portion is entirely missing. This is true of desert sand. At the other extreme, a soil may be completely organic. Peat, found in a bog or swamp, is totally organic soil. Organic materials are necessary for a soil to be fertile. The organic portion provides the nutrients needed for strong plant growth. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Soil Formation</h3>
        <p>Soil formation requires weathering. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner. However, soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick. Minerals and nutrients would have been washed out. Soil development takes a very long time. It may take hundreds or even thousands of years to form the fertile upper layer of soil. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, it may take thousands of years! How well soil forms and what type of soil forms depends on many factors. These include climate, the original rock type, the slope, the amount of time, and biological activity. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>Climate is the most important factor in soil formation. The climate of a region is the result of its temperature and rainfall. We can identify different climates by the plants that grow there (Figure 9.6). Given enough time, a climate will produce a particular type of soil. The original rock type does not matter. The same rock type will form a different soil type in each different climate. Rainfall Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. Temperature The temperature of a region is the other important part of climate. The rate of chemical reactions increases with higher temperatures. The rate doubles for every 10 C increase in temperature. Plants and bacteria grow and multiply faster in warmer areas. </p>

        <h3></h3>
        <p><img src="../../textbook_images/soils_20593.png" width=500px></p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 9.6 Climate is the most important factor in determining the type of soil that forms in a particular area. In tropical regions with high temperatures and lots of rain, thick soils form with no unstable minerals or nutrients. Conversely, dry regions produce thin soils, rich in unstable minerals.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Time</h3>
        <p>Soil formation increases with time. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. The warmer the temperatures, the more rainfall, and the greater the amount of time, the thicker the soils will become. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Parent Rock</h3>
        <p>The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces. Chemical reactions change the rocks minerals. A transported soil forms from materials brought in from somewhere else. These soils form from sediments that were transported into the area and deposited. The rate of soil formation is faster for transported materials because they have already been weathered. A soil is a residual soil when it forms in place. Only about one third of the soils in the United States form this way. The material comes from the underlying bedrock. Residual soils form over many years since it takes a long time for solid rock to become soil. First, cracks break up the bedrock. This may happen due to ice wedging. Weathering breaks up the rock even more. Then plants, such as lichens or grasses, become established. They cause further weathering. As more time passes and more layers of material weather, the soil develops. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Biological Activity</h3>
        <p>Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed. The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Soil Texture</h3>
        <p>The inorganic part of soil is made of different amounts of different size particles. This affects the characteristics of a soil. Water flows through soil more easily if the spaces between the particles are large enough and well connected. Sandy or silty soils are light soils because they drain water. Soils rich in clay are heavier. Clay particles allow only very small spaces between them, so clay-rich soils tend to hold water. Clay-rich soils are heavier and hold together more tightly. A soil that contains a mixture of grain sizes is called a loam. Soil scientists measure the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in soil. They plot this information on a triangular diagram, with each type of particle at one corner (Figure 9.7). The soil type is determined by where the soil falls on the diagram. At the top, the soil is clay rich. On the left corner, the soil is sandy. On the right corner, the soil is silty. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Soil Horizons and Profiles</h3>
        <p>Soil develops over time and forms soil horizons. Soil horizons are different layers of soil with depth. The most weathering occurs in the top layer. This layer is most exposed to weather! It is where fresh water comes into contact with the soil. Each layer lower is weathered just a little bit less than the layer above. As water moves down through the layers, it is able to do less work to change the soil. If you dig a deep hole in the ground, you may see each of the different layers of soil. All together, the layers are a soil profile. Each horizon has its own set of characteristics (Figure 9.8). In the simplest soil profile, a soil has three horizons. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Topsoil</h3>
        <p>The first horizon is the A horizon. It is more commonly called the topsoil. The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil. It is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground. The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many organisms live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil. These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Subsoil</h3>
        <p>Below the topsoil is the B horizon. This is also called the subsoil. Soluble minerals and clays accumulate in the subsoil. Because it has less organic material, this layer is lighter brown in color than topsoil. It also holds more water due to the presence of iron and clay. There is less organic material in this layer. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Chorizon</h3>
        <p>The next layer down is the C horizon. This layer is made of partially altered bedrock. There is evidence of weathering in this layer. Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from which this soil formed (Figure Not all climate regions develop soils. Arid regions are poor at soil development. Not all regions develop the same soil horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers. Others develop only a few. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Types of Soils</h3>
        <p>For soil scientists, there are thousands of types of soil! Soil scientists put soils into very specific groups with certain characteristics. Each soil type has its own name. Lets consider a much simpler model, with just three types of soil. These types are based on climate. Just remember that there are many more than just these three types. </p>

        <h3>Pedalfer</h3>
        <p>One important type of soil forms in a deciduous forest. In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter. Deciduous trees need lots of rain  at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are common in the temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer (Figure 9.10). This type of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile. </p>

        <h3>Pedocal</h3>
        <p>Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common (Figure 9.11). The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm of rain per year. With less rain, there is less chemical weathering. There is less organic material and the soils are slightly less fertile. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Laterite</h3>
        <p>A third important type of soil is laterite. Laterite forms in tropical areas. Temperatures are warm and rain falls every day (Figure 9.12). So much rain falls that chemical weathering is intense. All soluble minerals are washed from the soil. Plant nutrients get leached or carried away. There is practically no humus. Laterite soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. If laterites are exposed to the Sun, they bake as hard as a brick. </p>

        <h3>Soil Conservation</h3>
        <p>Soil is a renewable resource. But it is only renewable if we take care of it. Natural events can degrade soil. These events include droughts, floods, insect plagues, or diseases that damage soil ecosystems. Human activities can also degrade soil. There are many ways in which people neglect or abuse this important resource. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Harmful Practices</h3>
        <p>People remove a lot of vegetation. They log forests or prepare the land for farming or construction. Even just walking or riding your bike over the same place can kill the grass. But plants help to hold the soil in place (Figure faster than it is forming. In these locations, soil is a non-renewable resource. Soils may also remain in place but become degraded. Soil is contaminated if too much salt accumulates. Soil can also be contaminated by pollutants. </p>

        <h3>Protecting Soil</h3>
        <p>There are many ways to protect soil. We can add organic material like manure or compost. This increases the soils fertility. Increased fertility improves the soils ability to hold water and nutrients. Inorganic fertilizers also increase fertility. These fertilizers are less expensive than natural fertilizers, but they do not provide the same long term benefits. Careful farming helps to keep up soil quality each season. One way is to plant different crops each year. Another is to alternate the crops planted in each row of the field. These techniques preserve and replenish soil nutrients. Planting nutrient rich cover crops helps the soil. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of a field, or building terraces into steeper slopes all help to hold soil in place (Figure 9.14). No-till or low-till farming disturbs the ground as little as possible during planting. </p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. Describe two ways in which soil is a living resource. 6. Why do people add fertilizers to soil? 7. How does the C-horizon of a residual soil differ from the C-horizon of a transported soil? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Objectives</h3>
        <p>Discuss why soil is an important resource.
Describe how soil forms from existing rocks.
Describe the different textures and components of soil.
Draw and describe a soil profile.
Define the three climate-related soils: pedalfer, pedocal and laterite soil.
</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Soil is an important resource. Life on Earth could not exist as it does today without soil. The type of soil that forms depends mostly on climate but to a lesser extent on original parent rock material. Soil texture and composition plus the amount of organic material in a soil determine a soils qualities and fertility. Given enough time, existing rock will produce layers within the soil, called a soil profile. Ultimately, the climate of a particular region will produce a unique type of soil for that climate. </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>Why is soil such an important resource? Do you think a mature soil would form faster from unaltered bedrock or from transported materials? If soil erosion is happening at a greater rate than new soil can form, what will eventually happen to the soil in that region? Do you think there are pollutants that could not easily be removed from soil? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Without weathering, we would not have any soil on Earth. People could not live on Earth without soil! Your life and the lives of most organisms depend on soil. Soil is only a very thin layer over solid rock. Yet, it is the place where reactions between solid rock, liquid water and air take place. We get wood, paper, cotton, medicines, and even pure water from soil. So soil is a very important resource. Our precious soil needs to be carefully managed and cared for. If we dont take care of the soil we have, we may not be able to use it in the future. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Recall</h3>
        <p>1. What is the role of climate in soil formation? 2. What is the role of the parent rock in the creation of a soil? 3. Compare and contrast residual soils and transported soils. 4. Describe the characteristics of topsoil. </p>

        <p>This diagram depicts the layers of the Earth. The top layer is the O Horizon. This is the humus that is the surface litter, decomposing plant matter. Below that is the Horizon which is the topsoil. It is mixed humus and leached mineral soil. Below that is the E Horizon which is the zone of leaching. There is less humus and the minerals are resistant to leaching. Below that is the B Horizon. This is the subsoil that is an accumulation of leached minerals like iron and aluminum oxides. The final layer is the C Horizon. It is the weathered parent material that is partly broken-down minerals.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows that of the soil horizon. There are many types of soils, and each one has unique characteristics, like color, texture, structure, and mineral content. The depth of the soil also varies. The kind of soil in an area helps determines what type of plants can grow. Soil is made up of distinct horizontal layers; these layers are called horizons. They range from rich, organic upper layers (humus and topsoil) to underlying rocky layers (subsoil, regolith and bedrock). O Horizon-The top, organic layer of soil, made up mostly of leaf litter and humus (decomposed organic matter). A Horizon-The layer called topsoil; it is found below the O horizon and above the E horizon. Seeds germinate and plant roots grow in this dark-colored layer. It is made up of humus (decomposed organic matter) mixed with mineral particles. E Horizon-This eluviation (leaching) layer is light; this layer is beneath the Horizon and above the B Horizon. It is made up mostly of sand and silt, having lost most of its minerals and clay as water drips through the soil. B Horizon-Also called the subsoil-this layer is beneath the E Horizon and above the C Horizon. It contains clay and mineral deposits (like iron, aluminum oxides, and calcium carbonate) that it receives from layers above it when mineralized water drips from the soil above. C Horizon-Also called regolith: the layer beneath the B Horizon and above the R Horizon. It consists of slightly broken-up bedrock. Plant roots do not penetrate into this layer; very little organic material is found in this layer. R Horizon-The unweathered rock (bedrock) layer that is beneath all the other layers.</p>

        <p>The figure shows the different horizons and profiles of soil. The A-horizon is also called topsoil. This is the layer of soil where plants grow. Many small animals such as insects and worms also live here. Topsoil is rich in nutrients from decomposed plants and animals. Right under the A-horizon is the B-horizon, or the subsoil. If a plant has very deep roots, these roots may reach the subsoil. Subsoil contains very little organic matter. However, because of accumulated minerals such clay and iron, it holds more water than topsoil. Beneath the B-horizon is the C-horizon or substratum. The C-horizon is mostly composed of particles of bedrock, sediment, and other geologic materials.</p>
