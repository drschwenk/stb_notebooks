        <h3>Electric Circuit Basics</h3>
        <p>A closed loop through which current can flow is called an electric circuit. In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit. But home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Parts of an Electric Circuit</h3>
        <p>All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. The voltage source of the circuit in Figure 23.16 is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. In Figure 23.16, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. The circuit in Figure 23.16 also has two other parts: a light bulb and a switch. Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electric energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light bulb, electricity is converted to light and thermal energy. Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current through the circuit. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot flow through it. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Circuit Diagrams</h3>
        <p>When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called blueprints that show her how to build the house. The blueprints include circuit diagrams that show how the wiring and other electrical components are to be installed in order to supply current to appliances, lights, and other electrical devices in the home. You can see an example of a very simple circuit diagram in Figure 23.17. Different parts of the circuit are represented by standard symbols, as defined in the figure. An ammeter measures the flow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter measures the voltage. A resistor is any device that converts some of the electricity to other forms of energy. It could be a light bulb, doorbell, or similar device. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Series and Parallel Circuits</h3>
        <p>There are two basic types of electric circuits, called series and parallel circuits. They differ in the number of loops through which current can flow. You can see an example of each type of circuit in Figure 23.18. A series circuit has only one loop through which current can flow. If the circuit is interrupted at any point in the loop, no current can flow through the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work. In the series circuit in Figure 23.18, if one light bulb burns out the other light bulb will not work because it wont receive any current. Series circuits are commonly used in flashlights. You can see an animation of a series circuit at this URL: http://regentsprep.org/regents/physics/phys03/bsercir/default.htm . A parallel circuit has two (or more) loops through which current can flow. If the circuit is interrupted in one of the loops, current can still flow through the other loop(s). For example, if one light bulb burns out in the parallel circuit in Figure 23.18, the other light bulb will still work because current can by-pass the burned-out bulb. The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits. You can see an animation of a parallel circuit at this URL: http://regentsprep.org/regents/physics/phys03/bsercir/default.htm . </p>

        <h3>Electric Power and Electrical Energy Use</h3>
        <p>We use electricity for many purposes. Devices such as lights, stoves, and stereos all use electricity and convert it to energy in other forms. However, devices may vary in how quickly they change electricity to other forms of energy. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Electric Power</h3>
        <p>The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power. The SI unit of powerincluding electric poweris the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second. High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a microwave, can be calculated if you know the current and voltage of the circuit. This equation shows how power, current, and voltage are related: Power (watts) = Current (amps)  Voltage (volts) Consider a microwave that is plugged into a home circuit. Assume the microwave is the only device connected to the circuit. If the voltage of the circuit is 120 volts and it carries 10 amps of current, then the power of the microwave is: Power = 120 volts  10 amps = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts You Try It! Problem: A hair dryer is connected to a 120-volt circuit that carries 12 amps of current. What is the power of the hair dryer in kilowatts? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Electrical Energy Use</h3>
        <p>Did you ever wonder how much electrical energy it takes to use an appliance such as a microwave or hair dryer? Electrical energy use depends on the power of the appliance and how long it is used. It can be represented by the equation: Electrical Energy = Power  Time 1 Suppose you use a 1.2-kilowatt microwave for 5 minutes ( 12 hour). Then the energy used would be: Electrical Energy = 1.2 kilowatts 1 hour = 0.1 kilowatt-hours 12 Electrical energy use is typically expressed in kilowatt-hours, as in this example. How much energy is this? One kilowatt-hour equals 3.6 million joules of energy. Therefore, the 0.1 kilowatt-hours used by the microwave equals 0.36 million joules of energy. You Try It! Problem: A family watches television for an average of 2 hours per day. The television has 0.12 kilowatts of power. How much electrical energy does the family use watching television each day? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Electric Safety</h3>
        <p>Electricity is dangerous. Contact with electric current can cause severe burns and even death. Electricity can also cause serious fires. A common cause of electric hazards and fires is a short circuit. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>How a Short Circuit Occurs</h3>
        <p>An electric cord contains two wires. One wire carries current from the outlet to the appliance or other electric device, and one wire carries current back to the outlet. Did you ever see an old appliance with a damaged cord, like the one in Figure 23.19? A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord can also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. For example, if the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance. This may cause the wires to overheat and start a fire. </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Electric Safety Features</h3>
        <p>Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Each feature is described and illustrated in Table 23.1. You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL:  Electric Safety Feature Three-Prong Plug Circuit Breaker Description A three-prong plug is generally used on metal appli- ances. The two flat prongs carry current to and from the appliance. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground, which harmlessly absorbs it. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically opens a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on to close the circuit. Circuit breakers are generally found in a breaker box that controls all the circuits in a building. Electric Safety Feature GFCI Outlet Description GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amounts of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet opens the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover. </p>

        <h3>Using Electricity Safely</h3>
        <p>Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is not used safely. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity. Never mix electricity and water. Dont turn on or plug in electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow through the waterand youbecause water is a very good electric conductor. Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire. Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires. Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Plugging in other objects is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal. Never go near fallen electric lines. They could be carrying a lot of current. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon as possible. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>An electric circuit is a closed loop through which electric current can flow. A circuit must include a source of voltage and conductors such as wires to carry the current from the source of voltage and back again. Types of circuits are series and parallel circuits. Electric power is the rate at which an electric device changes electric current to another form of energy. It is measured in watts or kilowatts and equals current (amps) times voltage (volts). The electrical energy used by a device is measured in kilowatt-hours and equals the power of the device (kilowatts) times the amount of time (hours) the device is used. Electricity is dangerous. Electric shorts can be hazardous and start fires. Electric safety features include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Even with electric safety features, its important to use electricity safely </p>

        <h3>Points to Consider</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, you read that electric devices convert electrical energy to other forms of energy. For example, a microwave oven converts electrical energy to electromagnetic energy in the form of microwaves. A blender converts electrical energy to sound energy and the kinetic energy of the whirring blades. Do you think all electric devices convert electrical energy to other forms of energy? Computers are familiar electric devices. Do you know how they use electric current? </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Look at the battery and light bulb in Figure 23.15. The light bulb works and its connected to the battery, but it wont light. The problem is the loose wire on the left. It must be connected to the positive terminal of the battery in order for the bulb to light up. The reason? Electric current can flow through a material such as a wire only if the material forms a closed loop. Charges must have an unbroken path to follow between the positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this case, the battery. </p>

        <p>In this figure, you see a Series and a Parallel circuit. The circuits are composed of one battery, two lamps and wires. The battery provides the required voltage for these circuits, and the wire is used to conduct the electricity between different components of the circuit. The Series circuit is shown on the left and the Parallel circuit is shown on the right. There is only one loop in the Series circuit, while the Parallel circuit has two loops. The lamps in the Series circuit will be turned off if one of the circuit components get disconnected. However, one of the lamps in the Parallel circuit will remain on even if the other lamp is disconnected.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows a parallel circuit with a battery and 4 resistors. A parallel circuit has two or more paths for current to flow through. All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. The voltage source of the circuit in the diagram is a battery. Voltage is the same across each component of the parallel circuit. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. From the diagram, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. The diagram also has 4 resistors, which can be any device (such as a lightbulb) that converts some electricity to other forms of energy.</p>

The flow of electrons are shown by the arrows from the positive to the negative terminal through the light bulb. In the open circuit, the wire connected to the negative terminal is not connected to the light bulb. This prevents electrons from flowing through the circuit and the light bulb does not get illuminated.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows an open circuit. It consists of a bulb, a battery and wires connecting the bulb to the battery. The battery has two terminals, a positive and a negative terminal. A and B are the ends of the wire. In this diagram, A and B are not connected to each other. Hence the circuit is called an open circuit. Electric current cannot flow through an open circuit. Hence the bulb will not light up. If the ends of the wires, A and B were connected to each other, the circuit would be known as a closed circuit. Electric current would flow through this closed circuit which would lead the bulb to be lit.</p>

        <p>The diagram we see here is that of an electric circuit. There are four components in this circuit-the battery, the switch, the wire and the light bulb. The light bulb shall work only when it is connected to the battery. If the wire is connected loosely, the light bulb won't light because electric current needs a smooth path to flow the current. Wire is a very essential component as the current flows through the wire. Charges must have an unbroken path to follow between the positively and negatively charged parts of the voltage source, in this case, the battery. Electric current cannot flow through an open circuit. A switch controls the flow of current through the circuit. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot flow through it.</p>
