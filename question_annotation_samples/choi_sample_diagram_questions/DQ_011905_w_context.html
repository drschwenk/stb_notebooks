        <h3>Mendeleevs Periodic Table of the Elements</h3>
        <p>Mendeleev was a teacher as well as a chemist. He was writing a chemistry textbook and needed a way to organize the elements so it would be easier for students to learn about them. He made a set of cards of the elements, similar to a deck of playing cards, with one element per card. On the card, he wrote the elements name, atomic mass, and known properties. He arranged and rearranged the cards in many different ways, looking for a pattern. He finally found it when he placed the elements in order by atomic mass. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>A Repeating Pattern</h3>
        <p>You can see how Mendeleev organized the elements in Figure 6.2. From left to right across each row, elements are arranged by increasing atomic mass. Mendeleev discovered that if he placed eight elements in each row and then continued on to the next row, the columns of the table would contain elements with similar properties. He called the columns groups. They are sometimes called families, because elements within a group are similar but not identical to one another, like people in a family. Mendeleevs table of the elements is called a periodic table because of its repeating pattern. Anything that keeps repeating is referred to as periodic. Other examples of things that are periodic include the monthly phases of the moon and the daily cycle of night and day. The term period refers to the interval between repetitions. In a periodic table, the periods are the rows of the table. In Mendeleevs table, each period contains eight elements, and then the pattern repeats in the next row. </p>

        <h3>Predicting Missing Elements</h3>
        <p>Did you notice the blanks in Mendeleevs table (Figure 6.2)? They are spaces that Mendeleev left for elements that had not yet been discovered when he created his table. He predicted that these missing elements would eventually be discovered. Based on their position in the table, he could even predict their properties. For example, he predicted a missing element in row 5 of his group 3. He said it would have an atomic mass of about 68 and be a soft metal like other group 3 elements. Scientists searched for the missing element. They found it a few years later and named it gallium. Scientists searched for the other missing elements. Eventually, all of them were found. An important measure of a good model is its ability to make accurate predictions. This makes it a useful model. Clearly, Mendeleevs periodic table was a useful model. It helped scientists discover new elements and make sense of those that were already known. </p>

        <h3>The Modern Periodic Table of the Elements</h3>
        <p>A periodic table is still used today to classify the elements. Figure 6.3 shows the modern periodic table. You can see an interactive version at this URL:  . </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Basis of the Modern Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>In the modern periodic table, elements are organized by atomic number. The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom of an element. This number is unique for each element, so it seems like an obvious way to organize the elements. (Mendeleev used atomic mass instead of atomic number because protons had not yet been discovered when he made his table.) In the modern table, atomic number increases from left to right across each period. It also increases from top to bottom within each group. How is this like Mendeleevs table? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Reading the Table</h3>
        <p>Besides atomic number, the periodic table includes each elements chemical symbol and class. Some tables include other information as well. The chemical symbol consists of one or two letters that come from the chemicals name in English or another language. The first letter is always written in upper case. The second letter, if there is one, is always written in lower case. For example, the symbol for lead is Pb. It comes from the Latin word plumbum, which means "lead." Find lead in Figure 6.3. What is its atomic number? You can access videos about lead and other elements in the modern periodic table at this URL:  . The classes of elements are metals, metalloids, and nonmetals. They are color-coded in the table. Blue stands for metals, orange for metalloids, and green for nonmetals. You can read about each of these three classes of elements later in the chapter, in the lesson "Classes of Elements." </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Periods</h3>
        <p>Rows of the modern table are called periods, as they are in Mendeleevs table. From left to right across a period, each element has one more proton than the element before it. In each period, elements change from metals on the left side of the table, to metalloids, and then to nonmetals on the right. Figure 6.4 shows this for period 4. Some periods in the modern periodic table are longer than others. For example, period 1 contains only two elements. Periods 6 and 7, in contrast, are so long that some of their elements are placed below the main part of the table. They are the elements starting with lanthanum (La) in period 6 and actinium (Ac) in period 7. Some elements in period 7 have not yet been named. They are represented by temporary symbols, such as Uub. Many of these elements have only recently been shown to exist. Elements 114 and 116 were added to the table in 2011. Four more elements (113, 115, 117, and 118) were approved for addition in December 2015 and will be named at some later date. </p>

        </p>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>FIGURE 6.3 The modern periodic table of the elements is a lot like Mendeleevs table. But the modern table is based on atomic number instead of atomic mass. It also has more than 110 elements. Mendeleevs table only had about 65 elements.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Groups</h3>
        <p>Columns of the modern table are called groups, as they are in Mendeleevs table. However, the modern table has many more groups  18 to be exact. Elements in the same group have similar properties. For example, all elements in group 18 are colorless, odorless gases. You can read about the different groups of elements in this chapters lesson on "Groups of Elements." </p>
        
        <p>

        <h3>Apply Concepts</h3>
        <p>5. An unknown element has an atomic number of 44. Identify the elements symbol and the symbols of two other elements that have similar properties. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Mendeleev developed the first periodic table of the elements in 1869. He organized the elements by increasing atomic mass. He used his table to predict unknown elements. These were later discovered. The modern periodic table is based on atomic number. Elements in each period go from metals on the left to metalloids and then nonmetals on the right. Within groups, elements have similar properties. </p>

        <p>Elements are classified as metals, metalloids, or nonmetals. Do you know some examples of metals? How do you think metals might differ from the other two classes of elements? </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Scientists first started looking for a way to organize the elements in the 1700s. They were trying to find a method to group together elements with similar properties. No one could come up with a good solution. It wasnt until the 1860s that a successful method was devised. It was developed by a Russian chemist named Dmitri Mendeleev. He is pictured in Figure 6.1.

        <p>The following image shows the Periodic Table of Elements. This is a list of known atoms. In the table, the elements are placed in the order of their atomic numbers starting with the lowest number. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in that particular atom. In the periodic table the elements are arranged into periods and groups. A row of elements across the table is called a period. Each period has a number: from 1 to 7. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: hydrogen and helium. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer. The periodic table can be used by chemists to observe patterns, and relationships between the elements.</p>

        <p>This image shows the Periodic table. It is a table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, usually in rows, so that elements with similar atomic structure (and hence similar chemical properties) appear in vertical columns. This ordering shows periodic trends, such as elements with similar behaviour in the same column. It also shows four rectangular blocks with some approximately similar chemical properties. In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals on the left, and non-metals on the right. The rows of the table are called periods; the columns are called groups. The periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behaviour, and is widely used in chemistry and other sciences.</p>

        <p>Pictured below is a diagram of the periodic table. The periodic table is used today to classify elements. The elements in a periodic table are organized by the atomic number. The number of protons in an atom is what the atomic number represents on the chart. Rows on the periodic table are called periods. The columns in the periodic table are called groups. The modern periodic table have 18 groups. The elements are arranged in the periodic table by the atomic number from left to right from the lowest atomic numbers to highest.</p>
