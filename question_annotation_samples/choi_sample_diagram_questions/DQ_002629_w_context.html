        <h3>Solar Eclipses</h3>
        <p>A solar eclipse occurs when the new Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun (Figure 1.1). This casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks Earths view of the Sun. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun (Figure 1.2). When only a portion of the Sun is out of view, it is called a partial solar eclipse. Solar eclipses are rare and usually only last a few minutes because the Moon casts only a small shadow (Figure 1.3). As the Sun is covered by the Moons shadow, it will actually get cooler outside. Birds may begin to sing, and stars will become visible in the sky. During a solar eclipse, the corona and solar prominences can be seen. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun in such a way that the Sun is either partially or totally hidden from view. Some people, including some scientists, chase eclipses all over the world to learn or just observe this amazing phenomenon. A solar eclipse shown as a series of pho- tos.

        <h3>Lunar Eclipse</h3>
        <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon moves through Earths shadow, which only happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun and all three are lined up in the same plane, called the ecliptic (Figure 1.4). In an eclipse, Earths shadow has two distinct parts: the umbra and the penumbra. The umbra is the inner, cone-shaped part of the shadow, in which all of the light has been blocked. The penumbra is the outer part of Earths shadow where only part of the light is blocked. In the penumbra, the light is dimmed but not totally absent. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon travels completely in Earths umbra. During a partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the Moon enters Earths umbra. Earths shadow is large enough that a lunar eclipse lasts for hours and can be seen by any part of Earth with a view of the Moon at the time of the eclipse (Figure 1.5). A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because Moons orbit is inclined 5-degrees to Earths orbit, so the two bodies are not in the same plane every month. </p>

        <p>This diagram shows a lunar eclipse. In a lunar eclipse, the earth lies in between the sun and the moon. The shadow of the Earth can be divided into two distinctive parts: the umbra and penumbra. There is no direct solar radiation within the umbra. However solar illumination is only partially blocked in the outer portion of the Earth's shadow, called the penumbra. This is because of the Sun's large angular size. In this diagram, the moon lies in the umbra of the earth. This leads to a total lunar eclipse.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows solar eclipse. Moon rotates around the earth on an orbit that is shown in the picture. During solar eclipse, the moon lies between sun and earth so there will be a shadow on earth. Certain regions of earth will be dark due to the shadow of the moon since sun rays do not reach those regions. Moon is smaller than earth so the shadow covers a small region of the earth. The areas marked by Penumbera experience a partial eclipse, while Umbra areas experience full eclipse.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the lunar eclipse. The lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes behind the earth into its umbra region. During the total lunar eclipse, moon travels completely inside the earth's umbra. But in partial lunar eclipse, only a portion of the moon passes through earth's umbra region. When moon passes through earth's penumbra region, it is penumbral eclipsed. Since earth's shadow is large lunar eclipse lasts for hours and anyone with the view of moon can see the eclipse. Partial lunar eclipse occurs at least twice a year but total lunar eclipse is rear. The moon glows with dull red coloring during total lunar eclipse.</p>

        <p>This image shows the types of solar eclipses. When a new moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, it causes a solar eclipse. When the sun, moon and Earth are lined up, the Moon casts a shadow on the Earth and blocks our view of the Sun. When the Moons shadow completely blocks the Sun, it is a total solar eclipse. If only part of the Sun is out of view, it is a partial solar eclipse. An anular eclipse occurs when the edge of the sun remains visible as a bright ring around the moon.</p>
