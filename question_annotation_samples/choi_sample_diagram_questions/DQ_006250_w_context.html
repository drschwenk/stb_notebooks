        <h3>Overview of the Digestive System</h3>
        <p>The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also eliminates solid food wastes that remain after food is digested. The major organs of the digestive system are shown in Figure 17.10. For an entertaining overview of the digestive system and how it works, watch this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: </p>

        </p>
        <h3>The GI Tract</h3>
        <p>The organs in Figure 17.10 make up the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This is essentially a long tube that connects the mouth to the anus. Food enters the mouth and then passes through the rest of the GI tract. Food waste leaves the body through the anus. In adults, the GI tract is more than 9 meters (30 feet) long! Organs of the GI tract are covered by muscles that contract to keep food moving along. A series of involuntary muscle contractions moves rapidly along the tract, like a wave travelling through a spring toy. The muscle contractions are called peristalsis. The diagram in Figure 17.11 shows how peristalsis works. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Digestion</h3>
        <p>As food is pushed through the GI tract by peristalsis, it undergoes digestion. Digestion is the process of breaking down food into nutrients. There are two types of digestion: mechanical digestion and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion occurs when large chunks of food are broken down into smaller pieces. This is a physical process that happens mainly in the mouth and stomach. Chemical digestion occurs when large food molecules are broken down into smaller nutrient molecules. This is a chemical process that begins in the mouth and stomach but occurs mainly in the small intestine. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Absorption</h3>
        <p>After food is broken down into nutrient molecules, the molecules are absorbed by the blood. Absorption is the process in which nutrients or other molecules are taken up by the blood. Once absorbed by the blood, nutrients can travel in the bloodstream to cells throughout the body. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Elimination</h3>
        <p>Some substances in food cant be broken down into nutrients. They remain behind in the digestive system after the nutrients have been absorbed. Any substances in food that cant be digested pass out of the body as solid waste. This process is called elimination. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Digestive Enzymes and Other Secretions</h3>
        <p>Chemical digestion could not take place without the help of digestive enzymes and other substances secreted into the GI tract. An enzyme is a protein that speeds up a biochemical reaction. Digestive enzymes speed up the reactions of chemical digestion. Table 17.3 lists a few digestive enzymes, the organs that produce them, and their functions in digestion. Enzyme Amylase Pepsin Organ that Produces It mouth stomach Substance It Helps Digest starch protein Enzyme Lipase Ribonuclease Organ that Produces It pancreas pancreas Substance It Helps Digest fat RNA Most digestive enzymes are secreted into the GI tract by organs of the GI tract or from a nearby gland named the pancreas. Figure 17.12 shows where the pancreas is located. The figure also shows the locations of the liver and gall bladder. These organs produce or store other digestive secretions. The liver secretes bile acids. Bile acids help digest fat. Some liver bile is secreted directly into the small intestine. Some liver bile goes to the gall bladder. This sac-like organ stores and concentrates the liver bile before releasing it into the small intestine. </p>

        <h3>The Start of Digestion Mouth to Stomach</h3>
        <p>Does the sight or smell of your favorite food make your mouth water? When this happens, you are getting ready for digestion. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Mouth</h3>
        <p>The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters. The sight, smell, or taste of food stimulates the release of saliva and digestive enzymes by salivary glands inside the mouth. Saliva wets the food, which makes it easier to break up and swallow. The enzyme amylase in saliva begins the chemical digestion of starches to sugars. Your teeth help to mechanically digest food. Look at the different types of human teeth in Figure 17.13. Sharp teeth in the front of the mouth cut or tear food when you bite into it. Broad teeth in the back of the mouth grind food when you chew. Your tongue helps mix the food with saliva and enzymes and also helps you swallow. When you swallow, a lump of chewed food passes from the mouth into a tube in your throat called the pharynx. From the pharynx, the food passes into the esophagus. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>FIGURE 17.13 Teeth are important for mechanical diges- tion.</p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Esophagus</h3>
        <p>The esophagus is a long, narrow tube that carries food from the pharynx to the stomach. It has no other purpose. Food moves through the esophagus because of peristalsis. At the lower end of the esophagus, a circular muscle, called a sphincter, controls the opening to the stomach. The sphincter relaxes to let food pass into the stomach. Then the sphincter contracts to prevent food from passing back into the esophagus. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Stomach</h3>
        <p>The stomach is a sac-like organ at the end of the esophagus. It has thick muscular walls that contract and relax to squeeze and mix food. This helps break the food into smaller pieces. It also helps mix the food with enzymes and other secretions in the stomach. For example, the stomach secretes the enzyme pepsin, which helps digest proteins. Water, salt, and simple sugars can be absorbed into the blood from the lining of the stomach. However, most substances must undergo further digestion in the small intestine before they can be absorbed. The stomach stores the partly digested food until the small intestine is empty. Then a sphincter between the stomach and small intestine relaxes, allowing food to enter the small intestine. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Digestion and Absorption The Small Intestine</h3>
        <p>The small intestine is a narrow tube that starts at the stomach and ends at the large intestine. In adults, its about 7 meters (23 feet) long. Most chemical digestion and almost all nutrient absorption take place in the small intestine. The small intestine is made up of three parts: 1. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is also the shortest part. This is where most chemical digestion takes place. Many enzymes and other substances involved in digestion are secreted into the duodenum 2. The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine. This is where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. The inside surface of the jejunum is covered with tiny projections called villi (villus, singular). The villi make the inner surface of the small intestine 1000 times greater than it would be without them. You can read in Figure 17.14 how villi are involved in absorption. 3. The ileum is the last part of the small intestine. It is covered with villi like the jejunum. A few remaining nutrients are absorbed in the ileum. From the ileum, any remaining food waste passes into the large intestine. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Elimination and Other Functions of the Large Intestine</h3>
        <p>The large intestine is a wide tube that connects the small intestine with the anus. In adults, the large intestine is about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long. It is larger in width but shorter in length than the small intestine. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Producing and Eliminating Feces</h3>
        <p>Food waste enters the large intestine from the small intestine in a liquid state. As the waste moves through the large intestine, excess water is absorbed from it. The remaining solid waste is called feces. After a certain amount of feces have collected, a sphincter relaxes to let the feces pass out of the body through the anus. This is elimination. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Bacteria in the Large Intestine</h3>
        <p>Trillions of bacteria normally live in the large intestine. Dont worrymost of them are helpful. They have several important roles. For example, intestinal bacteria: produce vitamins B12 and K. control the growth of harmful bacteria. break down toxins in the large intestine. break down fiber and some other substances in food that cant be digested. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Digestive System Health</h3>
        <p>Much of the time, you probably arent aware of your digestive system. It works well without causing any problems. But most people have problems with their digestive system at least once in a while. Did you ever eat something that didnt agree with you? Maybe you had a stomachache or felt sick to your stomach. Perhaps you had diarrhea. These can be symptoms of food poisoning. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Food Poisoning</h3>
        <p>Food poisoning is the common term for foodborne illness. This type of illness occurs when harmful bacteria enter your digestive system in food and make you sick. The bacteriaor toxins they producemay cause cramping, vomiting, or other GI tract symptoms. Following these healthy practices may decrease your risk of foodborne illness: Wash your hands after handling raw foods such as meats, poultry, fish, or eggs. These foods often contain bacteria that your hands could transfer to your mouth. Cook meats, poultry, fish, or eggs thoroughly before eating them. The heat of cooking kills any bacteria the foods may contain so they cant make you sick. Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. This is especially important when food is packed for lunch or a picnic (see Figure 17.15). Maintaining the proper temperature slows the growth of bacteria in the food. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Food Allergies</h3>
        <p>Food allergies occur when the immune system reacts to harmless substances in food as though they were harmful germs. Food allergies are relatively common. Almost 10 percent of children have them. Some of the foods most likely to cause allergies include milk, shellfish, nuts, grains, and eggs. If you eat foods to which you are allergic, you may experience vomiting, diarrhea, or a rash. In some people, eating even tiny amounts of certain foods causes them to have serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing. They need immediate medical attention. The best way to prevent food allergy symptoms is to avoid eating the offending food. This may require careful reading of food labels. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>The digestive system is the body system that digests food mechanically and chemically and absorbs nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines. These organs make up the long tube called the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which goes from the mouth to the anus. Chemical digestion depends on the work of digestive enzymes and other substances. These are secreted into the GI tract by organs of the digestive system or by the pancreas, liver, or gall bladder. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Excess water is absorbed from food waste in the large intestine before it passes out of the body through the anus as feces. Trillions of helpful bacteria also live in the large intestine. They carry out important roles, such as making vitamins. Common digestive system problems include foodborne illness and food allergies. Following healthy food- handling practices may decrease your risk of foodborne illness. Food allergy symptoms can be prevented by avoiding the offending foods. </p>

        <p>Below is a diagram of the digestive system. The digestive system, as you can see, is made up of several organs and parts of the body. The digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients into your body. The mouth is the first digestive organ that food enters, and the saliva starts the digestion of the food. The esophagus is the long narrow tube that carries food from the oral cavity to the stomach. The stomach stores the food until the small intestine is empty. The liver and gallbladder produce and store other secretions from the food. For instance, the liver produces bile secretions. The large intestine is where the food enters after it leaves the small intestine, and the large intestine is connected to the anus. The anus is where the body releases the food as waste (feces.)</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the digestive system in humans. Each part of the system plays an important role--although some organs such as the gallbladder can be removed without causing any long term effects on the person. The mouth is the beginning of the digestive process. This is where mechanical breakdown occurs--the teeth, tongue, and saliva break down the food so it can travel down the esophagus more easily. The purpose of the esophagus is to move the food down the digestive tract. The stomach mixes the food with enzymes and continues the breakdown. The intestines continue the breakdown and move the food to the rectum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is also the shortest part. This is where most chemical digestion takes place. It then moves to the large intestine and then finally the rectum. The rectum is where the remaining food waste leaves the body.</p>

        <p>The diagram shows the human digestive system. It has several organs such as the liver, stomach, pancreas and intestines. Food enters the digestive system through the mouth and exits the system through the anus. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. In the stomach, chemicals called enzymes change the food into smaller molecules that the body can use. The pancreas is the part of the digestive system that produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. It is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. In the small intestine, our bodies absorb the nutrients from our food. Finally, the large intestine mixes the solid waste material with water so we can easily eliminate it from our bodies through the anus. Overall, there are 9 main organs in the Digestive system.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows major organs and general functions of the digestive system. The digestive system is the body system that breaks down food and absorbs nutrients. It also eliminates solid food wastes that remain after food is digested. It has several organs such as the liver, stomach, pancreas, colon and intestines. Food enters the digestive system through the mouth and exits the system through the anus. In the stomach, chemicals called enzymes change the food into smaller molecules that the body can use. The pancreas is the part of the digestive system that produces important enzymes and hormones that help break down foods. It is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. In the small intestine, our bodies absorb the nutrients from our food. Finally, colon mixes the solid waste material with water so we can easily eliminate it from our bodies through the anus.</p>
