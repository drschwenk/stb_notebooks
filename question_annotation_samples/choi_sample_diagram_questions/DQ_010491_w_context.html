        <h3>What Are Fungi</h3>
        <p>Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7.

        <h3>Classification and Evolution of Fungi</h3>
        <p>For a long time, scientists classified fungi as members of the Plant Kingdom. Fungi share several obvious traits with plants. For example, both fungi and plants lack the ability to move. Both grow in soil, and both have cell walls. Some fungi even look like plants. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Fungi Classification</h3>
        <p>Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified. </p>

        </p>
        <h3>Fungi Evolution</h3>
        <p>The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Structure of Fungi</h3>
        <p>Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Fungi Reproduction</h3>
        <p>Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores. A spore is a special reproductive cell. When fungi reproduce asexually, they can spread quickly. This is good when conditions are stable. They can increase their genetic variation by sexual reproduction. This is beneficial when conditions are changing. Variation helps ensure that at least some organisms survive the changing conditions. Figure 9.10 shows how asexual and sexual reproduction occur in fungi. Refer to the figure as you read about each of them below. </p>

        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Asexual Reproduction in Fungi</h3>
        <p>During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11. </p>

        <h3>Sexual Reproduction in Fungi</h3>
        <p>Sexual reproduction also occurs in most fungi. It happens when two haploid hyphae mate. During mating, two haploid parent cells fuse. The single fused cell that results is a diploid spore. It is genetically different from both parents. The spore undergoes meiosis to form haploid daughter cells. These haploid cells develop into new hyphae. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Roles of Fungi in Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>Most fungi grow on moist soil or rotting vegetation such as dead logs. Some fungi live in water. Others live in or on other organisms. Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. The other organisms may be dead or alive, depending on the fungus. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Fungi as Decomposers</h3>
        <p>Most fungi get organic compounds from dead organisms. Fungi use their hyphae to penetrate deep into decaying organic matter. They produce enzymes at the tips of their hyphae. The enzymes digest the organic matter so the fungal cells can absorb it. Fungi are the main decomposers in forests. They are the only decomposers that can break down cellulose and wood. They have special enzymes for this purpose. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Fungi Symbiosis</h3>
        <p>Many fungi get organic compounds from living organisms. They have close relationships with other species. A close relationship between two species is called a symbiotic relationship. Two symbiotic relationships in fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen. These relationships are beneficial for both species. Mycorrhiza is a relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plants roots. The fungus benefits from easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungal hyphae absorb water and nutrients from the soil that the plant needs. Lichen is a relationship between a fungus and cyanobacteria or green algae. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits by getting some of the food made by the photosynthetic cells. The bacteria or algae benefit by getting some of the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus. You can see a picture of lichen in Figure 9.12. Some fungi have a different kind of relationship with plants. They are plant parasites. They get food from the plants and cause harm to the plants in return. Fungi are the major causes of disease in agricultural crops. They may eventually kill their plant hosts. Some fungi are animal parasites. The wasp in Figure 9.13 is infected with a fungus. The fungus is the white fuzzy matter on the dark brown moth. </p>

        <h3>Fungi and People</h3>
        <p>Fungi may cause disease in people as well as other organisms. On the other hand, people have been using fungi for thousands of years. </p>
        
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Human Uses of Fungi</h3>
        <p>One way we use fungi is by eating them. Many species of mushrooms are edible. Yeasts are used for break making. Other fungi are used to ferment foods, such as soy sauce and cheeses. You can see the fungus growing through the blue cheese in Figure 9.14. The fungus gives the cheese its distinctive appearance and taste. People also use fungi: to produce antibiotics. to produce human hormones such as insulin. as natural pesticides. as model research organisms. </p>

        <h3>Fungi and Human Diseases</h3>
        <p>Several common human diseases are caused by fungi. They include ringworm and athletes foot, both shown in Figure 9.15. Ringworm isnt caused by a worm. Its a skin infection by a fungus that leads to a ring-shaped rash. The rash may occur on the head, neck, trunk, arms, or legs. Athletes foot is caused by the same fungus as ringworm. But in athletes foot, the fungus infects the skin between the toes. Athletes foot is the second most common skin disease in the U.S. </p>

        <h3>Lesson Summary</h3>
        <p>Fungi are eukaryotes in the Fungus Kingdom. Fungi include molds, which are multicellular, and yeasts, which are single-celled. Fungi are similar in some ways to plants but have unique traits that set them apart from plants. Fungi first evolved about 600 million years ago. Most fungi grow into multicellular threadlike hyphae. A mass of hyphae makes up the body, or mycelium, of the fungus. Most fungi reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction is by haploid spores (or by budding in yeasts). Sexual reproduction is by diploid spores. Most fungi are decomposers. They are the main decomposers in forests. Many fungi have symbiotic relation- ships with other species. People use fungi for food and other purposes. Some fungi cause human diseases. </p>

        <p>The diagram shows the asexual and sexual reproduction cycle of Fungi. In both types of reproduction, they produce spores which are a special reproductive cell. A mass of hyphae makes up the body, or mycelium, of the fungus. During asexual reproduction, mycelium produce haploid spores by mitosis through spore-producing structures of a haploid parent cell. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. After germination, spores develop to become mycelium. Sexual reproduction occurs when two haploid hyphae mate, and undergo plasmogamy (fusion of cytoplasm) to reach the heterokaryotic stage. Karyogamy (fusion of nuclei) then occurs to form a diploid cell called zygote. It then undergoes meiosis to form spores. The spores then undergo germination to become mycelium and the cycle continues.</p>

        <p>This diagram shows the asexual and sexual process of a fungi. Fungi can reproduce either of the two depending on the growth condition of the fungi. If the growth condition is stable, the fungi undergoes asexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction, the mycelium produces haploid spores via mitosis. These spores then spread themselves by air, water or other organisms. Once the spores landed on a place with stable growth condition, they will develop into new hyphaes. On the other hand, if the growth condition keeps changing, the fungi will exhibit sexual reproduction. Two haploid mycelia will fuse via plasmogamy and karyogamy, thus creating a diploid spore. This spore then produces haploid daughter cells via meiosis, which can then be developed into new hyphaes.</p>
