He saw that cork was divided into many tiny compartments, like little rooms. (Do the cells in Figure 3.1 look like little rooms to you too?) Hooke called these little rooms cells. Cork comes from trees, so what Hooke observed was dead plant cells. In the late 1600s, Dutch scientist Anton van Leeuwenhoek made more powerful microscopes. He used them to observe cells of other organisms. For example, he saw human blood cells and bacterial cells. Over the next century, microscopes were improved and more cells were observed. </p>\n",

       "            <p>By the early 1800s, scientists had seen cells in many different types of organisms. Every organism that was examined was found to consist of cells. From all these observations, German scientists Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden drew two major conclusions about cells. They concluded that: cells are alive. all living things are made of cells. Around 1850, a German doctor named Rudolf Virchow was observing living cells under a microscope. As he was watching, one of the cells happened to divide. Figure 3.2 shows a cell dividing, like the cell observed by Virchow. This was an aha moment for Virchow. He realized that living cells produce new cells by dividing. This was evidence that cells arise from other cells. The work of Schwann, Schleiden, and Virchow led to the cell theory. This is one of the most important theories in life science. The cell theory can be summed up as follows: All organisms consist of one or more cells. Cells are alive and the site of all life processes. All cells come from pre-existing cells. </p>\n",

The cell membrane is a thin coat of phospholipids that surrounds the cell. Its like the skin of the cell. It forms a physical boundary between the contents of the cell and the environment outside the cell. It also controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is sometimes called the plasma membrane. Cytoplasm is the material inside the cell membrane. It includes a watery substance called cytosol. Besides water, cytosol contains enzymes and other substances. Cytoplasm also includes other cell structures suspended in the cytosol. DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins. Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made. They consist of RNA and proteins. These four components are found in all cells. They are found in the cells of organisms as different as bacteria and people. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The answer is evolution. The similarities show that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor. </p>\n",

All the organisms in the Bacteria and Archaea Domains have prokaryotic cells. No other organisms have this type of cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. They are all single-celled organisms. They were the first type of organisms to evolve. They are still the most numerous organisms today. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 3.3. The cell in the figure is a bacterium. Notice how it contains a cell membrane, cytoplasm, ribosomes, and several other structures. However, the cell lacks a nucleus. The cells DNA is circular.

Living things with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes. All of them belong to the Eukarya Domain. This domain includes protists, fungi, plants, and animals. Many protists consist of a single cell. However, most eukaryotes have more than one cell. You can see a model of a eukaryotic cell in Figure 3.4. The cell in the figure is an animal cell. The nucleus is an example of an organelle. An organelle is any structure inside a cell that is enclosed by a membrane. Eukaryotic cells may contain many different organelles. Each does a special job. For example, the mitochondrion is an organelle that provides energy to the cell. You can see a mitochondrion and several other organelles in the animal cell in Figure 3.4. Organelles allow eukaryotic cells to carry out more functions than prokaryotic cells can. </p>\n",

For example, all cells can use energy, respond to their environment, and reproduce. However, cells may also have special functions. Multicellular organisms such as you have many different types of specialized cells. Each specialized cell has a particular job. Cells with special functions generally have a shape that suits them for that job. Figure 3.5 shows four examples of specialized cells. Each type of cell in the figure has a different function. It also has a shape that helps it perform that function. The function of a nerve cell is to carry messages to other cells. It has many long arms that extend outward from the cell. The \"arms\" let the cell pass messages to many other cells at once. The function of a red blood cell is to carry oxygen to other cells. A red blood cell is small and smooth. This helps it slip through small blood vessels. A red blood cell is also shaped like a fattened disc. This gives it a lot of surface area for transferring oxygen. The function of a sperm cell is to swim through fluid to an egg cell. A sperm cell has a long tail that helps it swim. The function of a pollen cell is to pollinate flowers. The pollen cells in the figure have tiny spikes that help them stick to insects such as bees. The bees then carry the pollen cells to other flowers for pollination. </p>\n",

       "            <p>Cells and organelles are made of biochemical molecules. These include nucleic acids and proteins. Molecules, in turn, are made of atoms. Figure 3.6 shows these different levels of organization in living things. As you can see in Figure 3.6, living things also have levels of organization higher than the cell. These higher levels are found only in multicellular organisms with specialized cells. Specialized cells may be organized into tissues. A tissue is a group of cells of the same kind that performs the same function. For example, muscle cells are organized into muscle tissue. The function of muscle tissue is to contract in order to move the body or its parts. Tissues may be organized into organs. An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissue that work together to do a specific task. For example, the heart is an organ. It consists of muscle, nerve, and other types of tissues. Its task is to pump blood. Organs may be organized into organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to do the same job. For example, the heart is part of the cardiovascular system. This system also includes blood vessels and blood. The job of the cardiovascular system is to transport substances in blood to and from cells throughout the body. Organ systems are organized into the organism. The different organ systems work together to carry out all the life functions of the individual. For example, cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide the individual with oxygen and rid it of carbon dioxide. </p>\n",

       "        <pre>\n",
       "            <p>Cells with different functions often vary in shape. They may also vary in size. However, all cells are very small. Even the largest organisms have microscopic cells. Cells are so small that their diameter is measured in micrometers. A micrometer is just one-millionth of a meter. Use the sliding scale at the following link to see how small cells and cell parts are compared with other objects. Why are cells so small? The answer has to do with the surface area and volume of cells. To carry out life processes, a cell must be able to pass substances into and out of the cell. For example, it must be able to pass nutrients into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Anything that enters or leaves a cell has to go through the cell membrane on the surface of the cell. A bigger cell needs more nutrients and creates more wastes. As the size of a cell increases, its volume increases more quickly that its surface area. If the volume of a cell becomes too great, it wont have enough surface area to transfer all of its nutrients and wastes. </p>\n",
